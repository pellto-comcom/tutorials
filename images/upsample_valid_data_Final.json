KlaySwap is a decentralized financial swap protocol based on Automated Market Maker (AMM). Currently, it has a total value of about $1.3 billion in its liquidity and deposits.\nThe details of this business agreement are as follows.\nWe plan to expand the TON ecosystem through Orbit Bridge, a tool that supports token swap between mainnets of heterogeneous chains developed by Ozys. The TON ecosystem is planned to expand to chains where the DeFi ecosystem is rapidly growing, such as Klaytn, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Huobi ECO chain (HECO). We expect that global users who have had difficult access to our ecosystem will be able to more easily participate through Klayswap (Klaytn), Pancake Swap (BSC), and more.\nTokamak Network will also provide advice on research for a bridge between Ethereum-based Layer 2 and other mainnets provided Orbit Bridge supports Ethereum-based Layer 2.\nIn order to deposit TON into KlaySwap, users first need to convert the mainnet to KTON through Orbit Bridge, a tool that supports token conversion between mainnets. (Conversion Guide) Tokamak Network expects to secure liquidity between the two cryptocurrencies by creating a TON-Klaytn pair and supplying initial liquidity to Klayswap which operates as a 100% smart contract on the Klaytn blockchain. Through this, users can directly exchange TON and Klay without a separate intermediate process, and users who provide liquidity can also receive a share of the fee generated from the pool.\nTokamak Network is holding an airdrop event within KlaySwap to commemorate the cooperation with Ozys and support for KlaySwap.\nThe event will be held for 2 months from the creation of the TON-KLAY pool in KlaySwap, and airdrops will be distributed to participants according to their contribution. You can check the details related to the event on the KlaySwap webpage.\nWe believe that this agreement has opened up the possibility of using TON in other chain ecosystems.

The viral coverage led to a group of seasoned technology entrepreneurs and automotive investors to discover Toerner's work and begin commercializing it as the Micro Bike — an all-electric, pedal-less, two-seater light electric vehicle that bridges the gap between a traditional e-bike and a motorcycle.\nNow, the concept is turning into reality starting with the first ever NFT auction to debut a vehicle. Although largely still in stealth mode, Micro is well-funded and led by serial entrepreneurs in the mobility space in its mission to become the \"Tesla\" of small electric vehicles. Today, Micro is launching its first ever vehicles in conjunction with NFTs that will be auctioned on Origin's NFT Launchpad. This is the first time that Origin has partnered with a company on its inaugural product launch, and we are very excited about how Micro is demonstrating new use cases for NFTs that are tied to the physical world. We imagine a world where performance vehicles and many other other high-end products are authenticated and tracked on the blockchain.\nThe Micro Bike Genesis Edition auction is for the first 16 vehicles ever to be produced, set to roll off the assembly line in early 2022, with each serial-numbered collectors' edition vehicle also paired with a matching digital art piece.\nThe top bidder in the auction will win the 1 of 1 \"Sun Edition\" vehicle, plated in gold. This will be the only vehicle ever produced of its kind. Imagine owning the first Tesla Roadster to ever roll off the assembly line in 2008. The next 5 bidders will win the 1 of 5 \"Mars Edition\" vehicles, plated in red copper, and the next 10 bidders will win the 1 of 10 \"Moon Edition\" vehicles, plated in storm white. The redemption rights will follow the NFTs and will be tradable until the time of production of the vehicles next year.\nTo the moon.

Learn more about all the cryptos we support here.\nDogecoin Is No Joke\nDogecoin is the people's money. It's organic, irreverent, and fun. It's not forced on us by a government or some other central authority, it's chosen by us, for us — by the people, for the people. Wow.\nFor many, the idea of emergent money that is not mandated by fiat is hard to grok. We're used to being told what money is. For most of our lives, paternalistic money is all we've ever known...until Bitcoin.\nDogecoin continues Bitcoin's tradition of giving the control of money back to the people. Yes, it's a meme coin, but all money is a meme. And all money is both an idea and a matter of faith or belief in it. Over the multi-milennia history of money, the majority of money (be it shells, beads, precious metals, etc.) has been what we the people say it is and believe it is.\nDogecoin is the perfect vehicle to lay bare this fundamental truth about money. And in serving this purpose, DOGE has a legitimate claim to some value. It reflects the true history and nature of money. It turns the idea of money being something that's issued by an authority — a conceit — on its head. They say there's some truth in every joke. Dogecoin's value is its punchline.\nDogecoin is as much a statement as it is a currency. A statement about the philosophy of money. The democratization of money. It's a protest against the fact that fiat money and the centralized financial system are not level playing fields. That they are built by a few and disproportionately favor those few. That too much power rests in too few hands.\nAnd the world is waking up to this. Nothing captured this more than the GameStop saga. We saw first-hand how the system is rigged against the individual investor and we can't unsee this. We saw how the individual investor can be more sophisticated than the most sophisticated institutional investors. Most importantly, we saw that the individual investor is ready to demand better. We don't believe it's a coincidence that global interest in crypto and Dogecoin spiked after individual investors were GameStopped.\nNo one person, organization, or authority decides the value of a crypto – its value is determined by its supply and your demand for it. In Dogecoin's case, its money supply is transparent, predictable, and disinflationary. The Dogecoin protocol issues a fixed amount of 5 billion DOGE every year. Over time, this fixed, annual issuance of 5 billion DOGE will represent a much smaller percentage of Dogecoin's overall money supply. This means the growth rate of Dogecoin's money supply is actually decreasing. In other words, Dogecoin's money supply is disinflationary. This is not dissimilar to how Ethereum's money supply of ether currently works. Recently, demand for Dogecoin has oustripped its supply. As a result, its price has been mooning. The people are speaking.\nAs the world ponders the popularity and meme-ification of a grammatically challenged dog, many are engaging in a referendum on centralized money and finance by joining the Dogecoin community. And the best part? They're doing it with a smile. So amaze.\nWe're not here to tell you what money is. We'll leave that up to you. We're here to empower you with greater choice, independence, and opportunity.\nOnward and Upward!\nTyler Winklevoss\nChief Executive Officer\nUpdated: May 5, 2021", "document_type": "new_listing", "categories": ["Exchange Name", "Date (Estimated Date)", "Name", "Symbol / Ticker", "Wallet creation and deposit requests opening date", "Trading opening date", "Withdrawal opening date", "Withdrawal fee", "Announced listing pairs", "Listing price", "Minimum Trade/Purchase Amount", "Minimum Price Movement", "Minimum Order Size", "Exchange promoted listing/airdrop event"], "answer_list": ["Gemini", "2021-05-04T00:00:00", "Dogecoin", "DOGE", "-", "Now Available", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-", "-"], "answer": "1.

The two parties in this ecosystem would be the value generators and value customers in a completed DeFi-NFT platform. It is fair to say that MetaverseSociety is not the first one to come up with such an idea. Many have thought of a similar approach before and similar projects entered the cryptocurrency market. But all of them failed to form a business ecosystem.\nTo avoid this limitation, MarX began with the fundamental structure that can take in changes through technological evolution. The project involves authentic partners who are already established in their respective fields.\nThe fund for the creation and completion of such a healthy and virtuous ecosystem comes as a donation from International Cultural Exchange Foundation. This international organization has been conducting donations for numerous projects for a long time. In addition to this, other contributors include Seoul 13, conducted by art researchers and HappyDog which is a pet-related cable broadcasting done abroad. Both contributions have increased the stability and expectations.\nMarX has already completed the beta version of its project for marketplaces that deal with art trade and it will be released soon. For this, it has deployed the DeFi-NFT platform. The recent boom in Bitcoin prices and IPO of Coinbase Global, Inc. (Coin) added Fuel to the Defi-NFT Market. It is what makes the digital asset to be unique and therefore distinguishable and interchangeable. Due to the recent controversies, MarX has chosen the MRC base instead of the ERC base.\nThe project team defined this change on the basis that ERC is constrained by brokerage fees and it also is prone to technologies that aim to take away the uniqueness of commodities thus separating the rights and copyrights from the creators. The MRC400 and MRC401 are immune to those and they also reduce brokerage fees.\nThis initiative is doing well in the Korean NFT market. The country being a place of admired art and lifestyle is booming in the NFT industry and the project has leveraged just that.\nWhere can you buy MARX?\nNDAU is now available to trade on Liquid.

After seeing explosive growth in global developer uptake, we are convinced that scalability and throughput in blockchain are now a solved problem. This is an inflection point akin to the moment that PC's became widely accessible in the 1970's,\" said Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana Labs Co-Founder and CEO. \"The next phase is onboarding a billion users. Solana was built from the ground up to accommodate this scale. With this funding, Solana Labs is now positioned to bring in the right partners and capital to build products and tooling to get there.\"\nSince the launch of Mainnet Beta in March of 2020, the Solana ecosystem has attracted tens of thousands of developers to its network and broke world records for the most number of participants in a hackathon. Due to the Solana protocol's innovative design, the network has become a prime breeding ground for developers seeking to build and deploy market-ready applications that are secure, fast, low-cost and energy efficient, all of which play critical roles in attracting the next billion users of blockchain and crypto technologies.\nAli Yahya, General Partner, Andreessen Horowitz: \"The next wave of innovation in crypto will happen at the application layer. It is easy to imagine countless use cases for crypto as a technology, but building them into real products that millions of people use requires the existence of a high-performance blockchain. Solana is a next-generation blockchain that can meet that high bar.\"\nThrough the use of Proof of History, Solana has dramatically reduced the congestion and redundancies that plague other decentralized blockchains. It has allowed the Solana protocol the ability to power on-chain transactions at the speed of Nasdaq matching engines for processing trades, orders, amendments, and cancellations, and breaks new ground of what's possible across DeFi innovations, exchanges, non-fungible tokens, marketplaces, payments networks, music sharing, gaming and more.\nOlaf Carlson-Wee, Managing Partner, Polychain Capital: \"We've been following Solana for a long time and believe it could massively scale the DeFi ecosystem. In our view, Solana is a compliment to Ethereum, and we're thrilled to see strong developer activity and a continually expanding community grow around the project.\"\nTo date, Solana-powered DEXes, dApps and platforms such as Serum, Raydium, Bonfida, KIN, Audius, Mango Markets, Maps.me, Pyth Network, Phantom wallet, USDC and more have processed more than 19 billion on-chain transactions. The new injection of funding will fuel Solana Labs with the resources necessary to further accelerate the development and launch of new DeFi, or Web3, projects across the ecosystem.\nAbout Solana\nSolana is the most performant blockchain in the world. It gives developers the confidence to build for the long term by delivering predictable scaling without compromising security or composability. Solana's performance is driven by intra-shard parallelism, which is capable of processing thousands of smart contracts at once, and by Proof of History, an innovation in distributed timekeeping that unlocks low-latency, sub-second finality across the global state.

This was due to extreme market volatility, unexpected external market manipulation and poor risk management. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and disturbance it brought to the community and thank everyone for their patience and support since.\nAs designed, the Venus protocol will protect the interests of asset suppliers as first priority. To rectify the shortfall in the two addresses, we are putting forward a proposal whereby XVS tokens will be released from the Treasury through the Grant Program to cover the loss. To reduce the price impact that the release may have on the XVS price, we are proposing for the XVS tokens to be released slowly over a 9 month period.\nAs an initial step, we aim to recover the protocol back to a sound state where suppliers are able to receive their supplied assets back 'at will' in the most systematic way possible. After rounds of internal discussion and community feedback, we've concluded that the most efficient way to clear the debt from the two bankrupted addresses mentioned above is to ensure that all the \"borrowed\" assets are back in the pool. This means that XVS tokens will need to be injected into the \"supplied\" balances of these 2 addresses for them to be liquidated and repay the \"borrowed\" balances.\nThe team at Venus discussed the ongoing situation with the Venus community and community coordinators from Binance Smart Chain, who have agreed to provide their support to form a community-driven council. Below are the details of the conclusions from the discussion:-\nTwo functions will be added into the Comptroller contract of Venus Protocol: the first is the Grant Program, which will allow the Treasury address to release XVS into an externally owned account (EOA) address based on the VIP vote; the second is a \"bailout\" function that allows an EOA address to inject funds into bankrupted address so that their debt is able to be repaid.\nAs part of the Grant Program and Council proposal, it is expected that ~3.3 million XVS tokens will be allocated to a public address owned by Binance to initiate the bailout;\nIf the proposal passes, the Binance-owned address will execute the following:\nOver a period of 9 months, 3.3 million XVS will be injected into the bankrupted addresses in a close-to-linear proportion using the \"bailout\" function so that the tokens can be slowly liquidated to repay the borrowed debt.\nBinance will compete as a participant in the liquidation events, and will reuse the liquidation fees in the next round of injection.\nResidual XVS (if any) will be returned to the Treasury.\n4. If, at any event, Binance runs out of XVS to complete the bailout event, more XVS may be allocated to cover the shortfall in goodwill.\n5. All existing income in the Venus fee treasury, (currently sitting at just above 10MM USD), will also be allocated in the same way to cover any remaining shortfall. These tokens will be used first.\nThe above proposals will be implemented should the community and XVS holders come to a majority in an upcoming vote. The above steps will be executed in full transparency on Binance Smart Chain and under close scrutiny from the community. We believe these measures will help restore the protocol to a healthy level, after which the new Council will maintain order and bring greater stability to the protocol.\nLatest updates:\nVenus 1.0 has completed a second Security Audit with PeckShield, with no major issues are identified, https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/PeckShield-Audit-Report-Venus-v1.0.pdf.\nNew VGP and Bailout changes to support Shortfall are in Audit now.\nVGP Github PR (Review audit in Peckshield):https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/47\nBailout Github PR (Review audit in Peckshield): https://github.com/VenusProtocol/venus-protocol/pull/51\n3.

After the redenomination, SUN.io will undergo a significant upgrade and introduce a new service - decentralized stablecoin swap. The SUN platform will be upgraded into TRON's first one-stop platform that supports stablecoin swap, token mining and self-governance. After the redenomination, the new SUN token, as a multifunctional governance token on the SUN platform (similar to the CRV token of Curve DAO and the EPS token of Ellipsis), will grant token holders various rights and benefits such as the voting and governance right in the community, value capture, staking rewards, etc..\nI.SUN Token Redenomination Plan\nThe SUN redenomination plan aims to lower the entry barrier of holding SUN tokens and facilitate the growth of the SUN ecosystem. The total supply of SUN tokens will be increased from 19,900,730 to 19,900,730,000 at a ratio of 1:1000, while the market cap of SUN remains unchanged. The volume of holding tokens in all addresses will be scaled in the same ratio accordingly. Details are as follows:\nAfter the upgrade, to differentiate between new and old SUN tokens, old SUN tokens will be renamed as SUNOLD (hereinafter old SUN tokens will be referred to as SUNOLD); the new SUN tokens will assume the SUN ticker with a brand-new logo;\nThe SUNOLD contract address is TKkeiboTkxXKJpbmVFbv4a8ov5rAfRDMf9; upgraded SUN contract address is TSSMHYeV2uE9qYH95DqyoCuNCzEL1NvU3S;\nSUNOLD swap channel will be opened on May 26, 2021 (SGT). You can swap for the new SUN by depositing your tokens on exchanges or by yourself on-chain. For details, please refer to \"SUN Token Swap\" below.\nII. SUN Platform Upgrade Plan\nSUN.io will be upgraded into TRON's first one-stop platform that supports stablecoin swap, token mining and self-governance.\nIn the initial phase, the SUN platform will first launch 3pool swap pool to enable the swap between USDT, USDJ and TUSD. The platform also has many other edges like lower handling fees, low transaction slippage, and low impermanent loss while offering greater swap efficiency and security. Going forward, the SUN platform will shortly launch plans such as token mining and platform self-governing so as to offer more rights and benefits to the community. As a governance token for the platform, the new SUN token grants community users various rights and benefits, including platform governance, value capture and staking rewards, etc.\nTimeline:\nMay 27, 2021 (SGT): enable stablecoin swap service;\nJune 2, 2021 (SGT): initiate new mining models of 3pool LP, SUN-TRX LP, SUN Stake and SUN Stake&Lock;\nJune 2, 2021 (SGT): start the airdrop to veCRV holders;\nThe community governance plan will be launched in the future, and the specific time will be notified separately.\nIII. SUN Token Swap\nThere are two ways to swap your SUNOLD for SUN depending on where you hold SUN tokens.\n1. SUN token swap on exchanges\nIf your SUN is held on centralized exchanges, please closely follow their announcements on whether they support SUNOLD-SUN redenomination as well as deposit, withdrawal, and trading of the new SUN. You may check the latest announcements from exchanges for this information.\nUsers who hold SUNOLD on any exchange that supports the SUNOLD-SUN redenomination do not need any action as the exchange will autoswap for you. You will be able to trade, deposit and withdraw SUN directly after the exchange completes SUN redenomination. For more information, please refer to the exchange's announcement on SUN redenomination.(To help users swap their new SUN smoothly, who will then be able to enjoy rights and benefits like mining rewards and governance on the new SUN platform, exchanges are advised to support the SUN redenomination plan as soon as possible. For any questions, please contact us via the SUN partnership email for details.)\nYou may withdraw SUNOLD to any decentralized wallet (like TronLink Chrome) and complete SUN token swap on JustSwap's \"SUN Swap\" page if the exchange hasn't yet supported the SUN redenomination plan.\n2. SUN token swap via the \"SUN Swap\" page on JustSwap If your SUN token is stored in a decentralized wallet (e.g. TronLink Chrome wallet)), please follow the \"Step-by-Step Guide\" below to swap your SUN token. This service will be enabled on May 26, 2021 (SGT), at which time users will be able to swap their SUNOLD tokens in their wallets for the new SUN tokens.\nStep-by-Step Guide\n1) Visit JustSwap official website and click on \"SUN Swap\" on the left navigation panel.\n2) Enter the amount of SUNOLD you would like to swap in the \"Amount to swap\" field and click on the \"Confirm Swap\" button (please make sure you have installed and connected your TronLink Chrome wallet).\n3) Sign and approve the action in your TronLink Chrome wallet.\n4) Your swap request has been submitted. The swap will be successful once the transaction is confirmed on-chain.\n5) After your swap has been completed, you can add the new SUN to your asset list by clicking on the \"+\" icon in your TronLink wallet. (If there is no prompt coming up, then you can add the asset by searching the SUN contract address on the TronLink \"Assets\" page: TSSMSHYeV2uE9qYH95DqyoCuNCzEL1NvU3S)\nmportant Notes\n1. At this moment, SUNOLD can only be swapped for SUN through the \"SUN Swap\" feature on JustSwap official website (users need to connect to their TronLink Wallet and swap manually) and certain exchanges that support SUNOLD-SUN redenomination (no user action required). Please do not use other channels for the swap to prevent financial losses;\n2. After the redenomination, SUN (the old token) will assume the SUNOLD ticker, and the new token will be named SUN. The two tokens will assume different logos. Please distinguish the old token from the new one according to their names, logos and contract addresses to prevent financial losses;\n3. After the denomination, the new SUN token will grant holders various rights and benefits such as governance right of the upgraded SUN platform, value capture and staking rewards, while the old token SUNOLD will only be used as mining rewards for previous mining pools in \"Century Mining\"(\"Century Mining\" event is expected to end at 20:59 on June 7, 2021, click to view details). Please stay alert of any frauds;\n4. The \"SUN Swap\" feature on JustSwap only supports swap from SUNOLD to SUN, and not the other way round;\n5. When depositing SUN tokens in an exchange, please make sure that the symbol and name of the SUN token supported by the exchange match the one you are depositing. If there's a mismatch, please do not proceed with your deposit. If you deposit an asset that is not supported by the exchange by accident, please contact the customer service of the exchange as soon as possible.", "document_type": "token_swap", "categories": ["Applicable Date(s)", "Announcement Type", "Purpose of token swap", "Other relevant information", "Token Name", "Swap Amount (Tokens)", "Supporting Exchange's Name", "Supporting Exchange's URL"], "answer_list": ["2021-05-26T00:00:00", "announcing_intentions", "Starting from May 26, 2021 (SGT), SUN will implement a token redenomination and platform upgrade plan to accommodate the requirements of the SUN project and infrastructure upgrade.

I am in charge of marketing in Landbox project.\nLandbox is a blockchain real estate project established based upon professional experiences in the existing real estate development and education industries. By utilizing \"prop-tech\" — a tech solution combining blockchain with real estate development — business development can be expanded. The first service product offered is \"AuctionOK\", an online real estate auction service based on blockchain. This product is aiming to solve the various inconveniences of the existing offline-based real estate auction system. A patent application has been filed to provide an online, non-face-to-face real estate auction service using blockchain.\nOnline real estate auctions lower the entry barrier for customers to participate in online real estate auctions and thus contribute to the expansion of this field.\nSegment 1- Project Introduction\nQ1) What is Features of Landbox Project?\nLAND Token is the utility token on our platform. It will be used to incentifies the users on the platform.\nOur platform has a few features but currently Auction OK is our first feature, which is blockchain based Real Estate Auction Platform.\nSecond we are preparing is Auction OK School, which is information sharing platform.\nThere are more services we are planning but those two will be the main.\nQ2) Partnerships are very important for the project growth, can you share with us some of your partnerships?\nRight now, we have IntelliQuant which is crypto trading partner, GOPAX which is Well Known Korean Exchange, and few more. You can check our partners on our website and we are preparing more partners in the industry and crypto world. Also We have partnered with Korea blood Cancer Asso. For donation auction. :) the donor will get NFT certificate for their donations.\nQ3) we have seen Investment in Real estate have been always a good option, will adding blockchain factor give more reasons to invest in ?\nLandbox is not a company invest in real estate directly, we are prop tech company in the real estate industry.\nYes, blockchain is key for the trust in the Auction Platform.\n\"method for providing intact [contactless] real estate auction service using block chain.\" The patent technology allows the encryption of auction bids and the storage and management of such information on a blockchain network, which prevents unauthorized manipulation of the bids entered online. By providing a contactless blockchain property platform, this technology also significantly eliminates the inconvenience of conventional auction system which requires bidders to be present at each bid site.\nQ4) Please briefly tell us about $LAND Token. What are it's utility?\n· Rewards in accordance with Auction OK's inquiry/answer/curation/content sharing\n· Auction OK real estate expert service payment\n· As the platform currency, LAND Token may be paid by users to access third party projects\nwhich they have connected with on the platform\n· Holders of LAND Token will be entitled to tiered membership benefits\n· LAND Token is accepted as the platform currency by the platform when a user accesses\nservices available on the LANDBOX Platform, for example real estate brokerage, appraisal or\ninformation services\nThose are in our whitepaper. We are brainstorming more stuff for the future as well.\nQ5) What can we expect from Landbox in near future, any new event/update?\nWe are preparing more partnerships in near future. Also Auction OK App developement.\nWe are also preparing Auction OK School. I am not sure when it will be done and you can actually see the product but we are developing now.\nI think we can launch in this year.\nSegment 2- Questions from Twitter\nQ1) How can LANDBOX solve problems of the current Real Estate Market?\nIt is important to identify what is the problem in the first place.\nWe are focusing 1 problem first. One of the major issue with Real Estate Auction system in Korea is that you have to go to offline court to participate the auction.\nReason is that online method cannot be ensured by participants that the auction bid data is not manipulated.\n\"method for providing untact [contactless] real estate auction service using block chain.\" The patent technology allows the encryption of auction bids and the storage and management of such information on a blockchain network, which prevents unauthorized manipulation of the bids entered online. By providing a contactless blockchain property platform, this technology also significantly eliminates the inconvenience of conventional auction system which requires bidders to be present at each bid site\nThe patent also includes a method of encrypting multiple bid logs after the conclusion of each auction sale. AuctionOK platform encrypts all properly entered bids so that the information about the bid price is hidden from everyone. After the bidding period is over, the bids encrypted into the blockchain network are decrypted so that the bids may be compared, and the winning bid selected. This allows the winning bid amount to be compared and verified with the one recorded in the value encrypted in the blockchain and ensures that there was no data compromise.\nAlso, usually information is not provided to every player in the real estate market.\nBuyers usually do not have enough info to make decisions as far as auction goes.\nSo, we will provide platform that experts share their knowledge and information can be consumed by others.\nQ2) Could you explain to me how the Landbox real estate auction platform works \"Auction OK\"? If you run real estate auctions, will it be able to hold a lot of money? How can users trust this Platform? And is it available for both IOS and android?\nIt does not need to held a lot of money in it. It is platform not actual buyer. Buyer(winner) and seller shall transacted to each other.\nUsers can trust platform by confirming the data on blockchain. every bidding data is stored on blockchain and can be confirmed.\nYes, we are developing apps now, it will be launched by this year.\nQ3) You refer to yourself as a \"Global platform for the exchange of information and real estate investment\", but could you really explain us about this \"exchange of information\" that Landbox provides?\nAuction OK is auction platform and it should have community in it.\nAuction OK School is a community service where users can share their knowledge about real estate. The users are able to share the information and knowledge regarding the real estate, and share the answers, columns, videos, etc. of the real estate specialists that are verified by Auction\nOK. The participants of Auction OK will be receiving community activity rewards and LAND points depending on their contribution rate, which can be traded into LAND tokens\nQ4) Will Landbox be directly associated with large local construction and real estate franchises? So Will Landbox seek to be a totally independent real estate and construction company?\nWe are more associated with real estate agencies not the constructions. Currently working on the on-boarding platform for real estate agencies so that they can sell their properties on the Auction OK.\nQ5) The LandBox's Business Model is based on a remote real state education platform and real estate investing platform, how do you plan to optimize the real states transactions in a smart-digital way incorporating blockchain?\nBlockchain stores the bidding data not the actual real estate selling transactions. Korean government already have the system for it. We are providing the auction system for better liquidity and selling method.\nWhen executing the bidding process, the bidding & key information is managed using the block- chain, and when this information is controlled by one server the problem will grow when the security issue occurs. To disperse this information, it uses 2-way management, which separates the key server and web server so that each server only manages on information (key server manages the bidding password key, and web server bidding information). Here, it is designed to indirectly control the blockchain by having the controller server in the middle, rather than controlling the blockchain directly. This is to manage the owner key information required for controlling the blockchain more safely.\nSegment 3- Live Telegram Session\nQ1 What if there is a dispute between the seller and the buyer, how will Landbox mediate it? and is there any aspect of legality and legal force in this transaction?\nOh this is acually a good question. Yes it could happen. We will provide consulting service for buyers and sellers. There are actually agent that will handle this matter. Real estate is not just crypto or stock. Its not traded by exchange. :) And yes there will be legal stuff. Haha. They need to register to Korean government\nQ2 Can you explain how is your Tokenomics Distribution? How many tokens Will be minted ? And How many tokens Will be locked by the team??\nThis is on our whitepaper and Xangle disclosure. Please read them though. All team tokens are locked until 2022.\nhttps://xangle.io/project/LAND/recent-disclosure\nQ3 Does #Landbox have a $LAND token that uses the BEP20 network, then where can I buy a $LAND token already listed on the exchange market or Dex or Cex, then has it been audited with certic or otherwise?\nYes. Land token is on Bep20. :)\nPancakeswap has land token. Erc20 and bep20. We did get audit from certik as well. Please check our medium.\nYou can trade our BEP20 LAND token here :\nhttps://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/swap?outputCurrency=0x557f20ce25b41640ade4a3085d42d7e626d7965a\nQ4 Can you please give us an overview of Tokennomics? And is there any plan for $LAND native tokens burn, mint, or issue new tokens in future?\nAll tokens are already minted. We have burn plan each q. We already did token burn once. Planning to burn more.\nQ5 Does your project support staking program?if yes. how is your stake system work, what is the requirement for user if they want to stake in your platform?\nNot yet. But we are planning. We call it Land-fi. Its also on our whitepaper.\nQ6 Do you have an NFT launch plan for Landbox?

CasperSign builds on this proven model by adding an additional layer of security and immutability for important agreements.\nBuilt on top of HelloSign, CasperSign is incredibly easy to use. Users go through the traditional HelloSign process of uploading a document and sending it to co-signers. Each party reviews the contract, signs digitally with HelloSign, and then signs on the Casper Network with CasperSign. Users don't need a CasperSign account to get started, and the process requires no knowledge of blockchain technology. Here's a quick demonstration of how it works:\nThe user uploads the document with CasperSign:\nThe user quickly and seamlessly signs with CasperSign:\nThe user verifies the document with the CasperSign validator:\nWith CasperSign, a public transaction takes place, which contains the SHA 256 hash of the signed document in the transaction notes. Using the SHA 256 algorithm to compute a hash of the files keeps the content confidential. The transaction is then appended to the Casper Network along with a timestamp. The transaction serves as the document's proof of existence, securing its integrity and immutability. Since all hashes are anchored to the Casper Network, all documents can be verified virtually forever, and viewed on the CSPR Explorer.\nSaid Medha Parlikar, Co-Founder & CTO at CasperLabs, \"The Casper Network is the first proof-of-stake blockchain designed to accelerate enterprise, so we're thrilled to see the first native dapp be something that executives and enterprises can use around the world.\"\nCasperSign was created by ChronoLogic, the R&D team at Digital Strategies. Digital Strategies is a crypto and blockchain investment and advisory firm, and an early investor in CasperLabs. The team actually mined the first Casper Network block that contained a transaction, and are now the first to develop a native dapp for the network.\n\"We are extremely excited to be the first dapp on the Casper Network. CasperSign is a great use case and we can't wait to see what other dapps the community will build.\" said Marcin Żółkiewski, Technical Lead at ChronoLogic.\nTo learn more about CasperSign, visit ChronoLogic's blog.

As pioneers of the NFT space, we are happy to have the support of Enjin in developing the Uniqly ecosystem as we build on Efinity.\nSince 2009, Enjin has been a major player in the digital space and transitioned into one of the leading figures in blockchain ecosystem development and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Since then, the Enjin Platform and its ERC-1155 token standard have helped countless projects mint and adopt NFTs with ease.\nUniqly is one of those projects, but it's more than that. We are proud to announce Enjin, which we believe will be one of the most valuable assets in the NFT world during the coming years, as a partner in this pivotal moment.\nLike Enjin, the team at Uniqly has designed a whole ecosystem that is being deployed right now as a bridge between the digital NFT world and the mainstream market. Based on the UNIQ token, the system functions as a marketplace, an escrow service, and NFT generator, allowing for the materialization of NFTs into physical items.\nAs we develop the Uniqly ecosystem on Enjin's upcoming Efinity blockchain, we will work hand in hand with their team to push the technical boundaries of the NFT space.\nSoon, we will have the first planned release of the year: A limited-edition collection of designer NFT shirts, all redeemable via token burn process. We have planned a generation system, where each shirt will have a unique serial number.\nFrom the 1,000 available designs, users will be able to choose from which tier they want to purchase their shirt, and an RTF will then assign them a specific design from that bracket.\nThis is the first collection of clothing NFTs backed by actual physical products, and we are proud to announce our collaboration with the Enjin team at a time where the world is looking to use NFTs in more innovative ways.\nEnjin isn't new to endorsing promising start-ups, and working with them will aid us tremendously in the coming months.\nWith the help of their robust blockchain infrastructure, we will enable faster, smoother, and more secure transactions. Their tools and services will be a key factor for the fast growth and organic development of the Uniqly platform, and ensuring ease of use for our ecosystem.\nEnjin has always been known for its versatility and utility, but we are working with them because we understand their drive for relentless innovation.\nThey have bridged the gap between many separate ecosystems, from gaming to fashion and digital art, and we are excited to provide an easy bridge between the physical market and the digital one.\nWith the introduction of Efinity in March, they unveiled a vision of an interconnected cross-chain NFT market, where users can easily use and receive NFTs from any blockchain.\nWorking with Enjin will allow us to take the first step towards a global, decentralized market that blurs the lines between the physical and digital world.\nMoving forward, their non-fungible tech stack will bring unbounded liquidity to their partners and an unprecedented user experience to the NFT community.\nProjects like Uniqly will be able to function at higher speeds, with faster transactions, trades, and highly optimized features.\nThe paradigm shift has already begun and we are incredibly excited to be one of the engines of change, pushing towards a new form of meritocratic market.\nClosure time.\nBuild with Enjin: If you're a developer, creator, or brand interested in creating NFTs, please get in touch with the Enjin team.

INTRODUCTION\n2. QUESTION FROM TWTITTER\n3. FREE ASKING\nSESSION 1 ( INTRODUCTION )\nID CRYPTO:\nHello Etham welcome to our community, we are glad to be with you here.\nEtham :\nHi ID CRYPTO.\nID CRYPTO:\nThank you for being here.\nYes, Please introduce yourself and tell how you started a crypto business to the idcrypto community?\nEtham :\nHello. My name is Etham and I am marketing team at Landbox. I started as investor as most of you. The first Bitcoin that I bought was early 2017.\nSince then, never left crypto world and now I am building a project as well.\nID CRYPTO:\nGreetings to Etham.\nEtham :\nGlad to be here.\nID CRYPTO:\nThank you very much, Can you explain what is Landbox and how long your project launch? Please explain in simple sentences.\nEtham :\nLandbox is prop-tech project that focuses on Real estate auction system and community.\nWe launched our company in 2019 Q3. We started as very start-up and we actually started as real estate development company.\nThen launched the Landbox project in 2020 2Q. Now, it has been one year ! Wow time is fast.\nID CRYPTO:\nWow, Landbox has been running for a long time, I hope that in the future the landbox will be even more successful.\nCan you share with the community what LandBox has been doing from the roadmap ?\nEtham :\nWe finally launched our Auction OK beta service a month ago. We are planning to launch official 1.0 version in this summer. We also will launch Auction OK School as well in this year.\nSESSION 2 ( QUESTION FROM TWTITTER )\nID CRYPTO:\nWhere is the base of your project location? Is it safe to invest in blockchain applied real estate?\nfrom @Rozer444\nEtham:\nWe are located in South Korea. We are not directly investing into real estate. we are prop tech project that is part of real estate industry.\nA lot of people mis understand the blockchain and real estate. We are utility token NOT STO.\nID CRYPTO:\nwell, already answered by Mr. Etham, I hope the community can understand.\nEtham:\nI hope so.\nID CRYPTO:\nQuestion 2\nWill there be any improvements or changes in your project ..? I wonder how to find out whether or not the auction will turn out ?\nfrom @HarisS07047838\nEtham:\nYes. We are building better services as day goes. Its not finished product as most of start ups. We will adopt and develop as our users and the market needs.\nAuction oK need a lot more development from now on. Eventually it should handle online real estate market place in the future.\nID CRYPTO:\nQuestion 3\nThe global world of information exchange and real estate investment has always been very traditionalist. What did Landbox see in the real estate world that encouraged you to build on this? What aspects of DeFi, besides security, enhance the real estate world within Landbox?\nfrom @TheShadowJK_1\nEtham:\nAs I said already We are not directly investing into real estate. We are prop tech project that is part of real estate industry.\nEspecially focusing on Auction system and also knowledge sharing platform.\nActually the real estate is going to online as time goes. In the last five years, the amount invested in the global prop-tech has\nincreased up to ten times. According to the data released by the startup company Alliance since\nOctober 2015, the number of startups that have obtained more than series A (around 1 billion\nKRW) from the venture capitals has increased from 76 companies in October 2015 to 807 companies in September 2020.\nID CRYPTO:\nThanks for the detailed answer, Question 4.\nThe LandBox's Business Model is based on a remote real state education platform and real estate investing platform, how do you plan to optimize the real states transactions in a smart-digital way incorporating blockchain?\nfrom @hukaeabc\nEtham:\nAgain, we are not using blockchain as real estate transactions. But Yes, blockchain is key for the trust in the Auction Platform.\n\"method for providing contactless real estate auction service using block chain.\" The patent technology allows the encryption of auction bids and the storage and management of such information on a blockchain network, which prevents unauthorized manipulation of the bids entered online. By providing a contactless blockchain property platform, this technology also significantly eliminates the inconvenience of conventional auction system which requires bidders to be present at each bid site.\nID CRYPTO:\nLast Question\nRight now issuing a token is a fairly simple process. However, building systems & ecosystems is the hardest part. My question is, how will the demand for tokens increase & how will this token be used in the ecosystem?\nfrom @Monisona10\nEtham:\nTrue. Building system is hard. We are still early stage and building actual eco system will take years. But we are ready for it.\nFollowing is the token usage.\n· Rewards in accordance with Auction OK's inquiry/answer/curation/content sharing.\n· Auction OK real estate expert service payment.\n· As the platform currency, LAND Token may be paid by users to access third party projects which they have connected with on the platform\n· Holders of LAND Token will be entitled to tiered membership benefits.\n· LAND Token is accepted as the platform currency by the platform when a user accesses services available on the LANDBOX Platform, for example real estate brokerage, appraisal or information services.\nThose are in our whitepaper. We are brainstorming more stuff for the future as well.\nID CRYPTO:\nMaybe you can share your whitepaper here, so our community can read it.\nEtham:\nSure. The WhitePaper link\nID CRYPTO:\nThank you for the whitepaper.\nSESSION 3 ( FREE ASKING )\nAmelia:\nWill the OK school launch auction be on a global scale or only for Korea? how to register and what are the requirements?\nEtham:\nFor now, we will launch only in Korea. We will expend to global when our service is ready. it will take a while imo.\nRime Resj:\nhow many tokens will you burn later? will it be burnt as a whole so that the tokens that have been stored in the user's wallet also decrease, or burn the tokens that you still store and have not yet circulated?\nEtham:\nWe will burn what we buy back from the market, which is based on our company profit, thus, we do not know yet.\nwhen we burn, we buy from the exchanges so users tokens will remain same. Thus, circulation will be decreased.\nAgus:\nCan you get rid of our worries when data forgery or changes in online bidding?\nEtham:\nThis is exactly why we adopted blockchain into our platform. We already got Korea Patent for this. Please check article.\nHukaeabc:\nHow is Landbox tokenomics distributed? How many tokens will be printed? And how many tokens will the team lock?\nEtham:\nYou can check on our whitepaper. All tokens are already minted and there will be no more tokens. And you can check all lock status at Xangle.\nWhen the lock status changes we will announce on our twitter, medium, and Xangle as well.\nCRYPTONECO :\nWhich of the DeFi, Staking, NFT and Dapps tools is your team currently spending more time on to take your project's development to the next level? In the short term, will you have news about these areas?\nEtham:\nWe are focusing on NFT. We already have something called donation auction on our platform.\nMORE DETAIL ABOUT Landbox", "document_type": "ir_event", "categories": ["IR Activity Type", "Applicable Date(s)", "Online event", "Offline event Location", "Offline event Address", "Purpose", "Details", "Sponsorships Name", "Sponsorships Details", "Related Disclosure"], "answer_list": ["ama: ", "2021-05-19T15:00:00 ~ ", "https://t.me/idcrypto_official", "-", "-", "IDCrypto AMA", "TitleAMA IDCRYPTO X LandboxDate and Time20 May 2021 2:00 PM UTCProgram1.

Metaverse is absorbing all the market's attention with its powerful ripple effect, which is considered the most innovative industry transformation since the popularization of the Internet in the 1990s and the spread of smartphones in 2007.\nMetaverse is implemented through eXtended reality (XR) technology, it still requires a core technology to reliably support it. Therefore, blockchain technology is in the spotlight within Metaverse to create an environment where assets can be safely owned and traded like the real world. In addition, NFT, which certifies ownership of various digital goods, and cryptocurrency, a means of transferring goods between online entities, has become a vital element of the Metaverse.\nBOSAGORA declares 'Metachain' optimized for Metaverse\nBOSAGORA has become the most suitable blockchain for the Metaverse environment because of its flash layer, enabling safe, accurate, fast, and low-cost transactions. Accordingly, we declare that BOSAGORA's blockchain is a 'Metachain' optimized for the Metaverse. Furthermore, we intend to build a Metaverse ecosystem by working with related companies with the highest level of technology to create a blockchain-based Metaverse called \"MetaCity\".\nThe MetaCity aims for Metaverse that cover unprecedentedly broad areas. The MetaCity is a new online world where everything you enjoy in the real world, including finance like T-Fi, government-led public education, commerce with large global brands, and entertainment such as games and content.\nTo make this a reality, BOSAGORA launched the MetaCity Forum with the world's best-related partners.\nConfiguration of Forum\nTo create the most comprehensive and complete Metaverse, BOSAGORA has formed the 'MetaCity Forum' with the following partners to develop MetaCity\nBOSAGORA, a blockchain dedicated to Metaverse with a flash layer\nBlockchain's scalability problem is one of the trilemma issues of blockchain along with decentralization and security issues. Bitcoin has created a Lightning network that solves transaction speed and transfer fees, and Ethereum is trying to overcome this through sharding using distributed DB technology, and plasma, or roll-up as a side chain.\nBOSAGORA developed the flash layer for the same reason. The flash layer solves the problems of transaction speed and scalability by processing micro-transactions such as payment and only connecting the results to the blockchain.\nWith the powerful features of instant payment (quickness), reliable transmission (accuracy), secure network (security), and low commission (economic), The MetaCity users can quickly move assets anywhere, anytime within the MetaCity. In addition, millions of simultaneous users at a time and near-infinite transactions per second, enabling them to enjoy seamless the MetaCity anywhere in the world.\nWith the MetaChain that embraces the flash layer, BOSAGORA will strive to make the \"MetaCity\" be the largest Metaverse ecosystem that includes numerous Metaverse services.\nhttps://bosagora.io\nAiitone, the best Metaverse simulation solution company\nAiitone, a KOSDAQ-listed company specialized in AI technology and intelligent training technology using VR, AR, and MR, has a wide range of AI and VR solutions ranging from VR English conversation content 'VR New York Story' to voice recognition AI and intelligent defense.\nAiitone is ready to lead the Metaverse era with its XR platform, which is widely used as an \"extended reality\" using its technology, which will help construct Metaverse services.\nhttp://www.aiitone.com\nUracle, Korea's leading mobile app standardisation & blockchain middleware company\nFrom mobile services to blockchain middleware, Uracle is developing various mobile businesses based on the technology required for IT services.

And more brands are now preparing a lot of business, content, and advertisements on 'Metaverse' past TV, social media platforms, YouTube, and Netflix.\nThe Metaverse world is ultimately made up of people's desires and curiosity. Some will play games and decorate their characters, some will stream music and buy merchandise for their star, and some will shop and order food. In other words, where there is people's consumption, there will always be demand for commerce, payment, and virtual currencies, and the market always requires a stable system. Therefore, where everything is digital, the Metaverse ecosystem is vital for stability and scalability and requires the most optimized network, such as a blockchain.\nTherefore, BOSAGORA intends to implement the \"MetaCity\", a blockchain-based Metaverse based on a stable blockchain and a flash layer with the highest scalability.

By default, v2.3.0 deploys Horizon's new architecture. It runs a mini-Stellar Core (aka Captive Core) as a subprocess of Horizon, so you don't need to run a standalone Stellar Core node, and you don't need to take any additional steps to update Stellar Core. Just upgrade to this version of Horizon, and you're good to go.\nWhile we advise everyone who runs Horizon to deploy the new architecture, we also understand that some people still rely on legacy architecture and run Horizon along with a standalone Stellar Core node. If that's the case for you, and you would like to keep it that way, you can disable Captive Core by setting ENABLE_CAPTIVE_CORE_INGESTION=\"false\" env variable. In this case, you will also need to upgrade Stellar Core separately to v17.0.0.\nIf you run Stellar Core\nUpgrade to Stellar Core v17.1.0. If your node is running a pre-17.0.0 version of Stellar Core when the network upgrades, it will throw an error and lose sync. If your node is a validator, you can arm your it to vote for the upgrade with the following command:upgrades?mode=set&upgradetime=2021-06-01T15:00:00Z&protocolversion=17\nFor more information, see the Upgrading the Network doc. To stay in the loop as we coordinate that vote, join the stellar.public #validators channel on Keybase.\nIf you have a custom Stellar integration\nIf you're using Stellar but you're not using a Stellar SDK, you will likely need to manually update your code. You may want to check out the JS SDK issue that outlines the changes necessary to adapt to Protocol 17.\nAlso, please contact me and let me know everything you can about your custom integration.

I would like to share more insight into that decision and our future.\nWhy the change?\nVoice is steadfast in our mission to create social as it should be, using blockchain and crypto technologies to empower creators.\nWe set out optimistically to work with regulators in the US to gain approval for our fungible and transferable Voice Token. We believe the Voice Token can both fix much of social media and powerfully leverage EOS mainnet.\nAfter more than 18 months of close engagement with regulators, we do not have an end in sight yet. The change of administrations has introduced further uncertainty. Recent actions by the SEC indicate a long road ahead. We remain in pursuit of those approvals, but we do not have an end in sight yet.\nWhy NFTs?\nNFTs represent a new media format altogether. The kind that can disrupt the status quo and render existing platforms obsolete. And, in their purest forms, they're decidedly not securities. By tokenizing the content itself, instead of putting tokens next to the content, we are giving creators the opportunity to monetize their work directly. Voice has found a better path to empowering creators and leveraging EOS mainnet.\nWhile we are moving towards building on EOS mainnet, we are not able to from day one for three reasons. First, the New York State Department of Financial Services does not permit EOS (amongst many other tokens) to be traded in New York state. Secondly, our proprietary file storage system requires buy-in from major block producers that we cannot guarantee.\nLastly, and most importantly, our NFT protocol (built on top of SimpleAsset) needs to be released and widely adopted on mainnet in order for us to guarantee that our creators will always earn their royalties. The current honor system has already been undermined by a growing black market. We will work on solving all three of those issues with the help of the EOS community. But it cannot happen in time for our launch this summer.

Coinbase customers can now buy, sell, convert, send, receive, or store DOGE in all Coinbase-supported regions. DOGE trading is also supported on Coinbase Pro.\nDogecoin (DOGE) was created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The Dogecoin name and Shiba Inu logo are based on a meme. Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed to be scarce, Dogecoin is intentionally abundant — 10,000 new coins are mined every minute and there is no maximum supply.\nOne of the most common requests we hear from customers is to be able to buy and sell more cryptocurrencies on Coinbase. We announced a process for listing assets, designed in part to accelerate the addition of more cryptocurrencies. We are also investing in new tools to help people understand and explore cryptocurrencies. We launched informational asset pages (see DOGE), as well as a new section of the Coinbase website to answer common questions about crypto.\nCustomers can sign up for a Coinbase account here to buy, sell, convert, send, receive, or store DOGE today.\nThis website contains links to third-party websites or other content for information purposes only (\"Third-Party Sites\").

The DVI cross-chain (ETH <-> BSC) bridge, built in cooperation with Curvegrid, will be a crucial enhancement for the Dvision Network. It will enable DVI holders to seamlessly bridge their ERC-20 based DVI tokens over to the Binance Smart Chain's BEP-20 based DVI tokens. However, due to security concerns and high gas fees that will be incurred during the transfer, Dvision has decided to disable the \"Transfer Functionality\" for the wider public and will enable direct access to BEP-20 DVI tokens through a liquidity pool powered by PancakeSwap. The listing details on PancakeSwap will be disclosed later and won't be carried out right away due to the extreme fluctuations in the market.\nBinance Smart Chain\nWe have previously disclosed the primary reasons why we have decided to partially migrate to the Binance Smart Chain. We mentioned that it is correlated to our vision and belief in BSC as an ecosystem that unlocks the next generation of dApps. BSC is a highly scalable blockchain that supports smart contracts and Ethereum Virtual Machine programmability, featuring high TPS (transactions per second), and fast, decentralized trading with low fees.\nThe Looking Glass Bridge (Cross-Chain)\nDvision Network's ETH ←→ BSC Cross-Chain bridge is powered by the Looking Glass tool, which is built on top of MultiBaas. In the first stage, the bridge will be exploited internally by authorized relayers in order to move over X amount of ERC-20 based DVIs from the Ethereum Mainnet to BEP-20 based DVIs on the Binance Smart Chain. The bridge is currently in full operating condition but is being reviewed for security checks. It's planned to be opened up for wider access in early June.\nThe BEP-20 DVI Token\nAlthough the bridge will initially be exploited internally, that does not change the ultimate purpose of the bridge. We will allow the usage and purchase of the BEP-20 DVI tokens through a separate DEX listing by creating and providing a liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. A separate announcement regarding the listing details will be provided very soon, stay tuned! The listing details on PancakeSwap will be disclosed later and, it should be noted, that it won't be carried out right away due to the extreme fluctuations in the market.\nIt makes more sense to purchase the BEP-20 based DVI tokens directly from the liquidity pool to avoid incurring high gas fees during a transfer through the bridge. For instance, anyone who wishes to hold the BEP-20 based DVI tokens should acquire them directly from PancakeSwap rather than purchase DVIs from Ethereum-based DEXs. If you purchase DVIs from there, you will pay $50–60 just on gas fees and pay additional gas fees while swapping the ERC-20 based DVIs to BEP-20 based DVIs.", "document_type": "milestone_achievement", "categories": ["Name", "Date", "Accomplished", "Details"], "answer_list": ["Dvision Network launches Binance Smart Chain Bridge", "2021-05-20T00:00:00", "YES", "On May 20th, 2021, Dvision Network announced the release of its Binance Smart Chain Bridge, marking the beginning of the $DVI token in BEP20 standard.

Here's a quick rundown of how CityCoins work:\nCityCoins like $MIA are mined by forwarding Stacks tokens (STX) into a CityCoins smart contract. (If you don't want to mine $MIA yourself, you can buy it on an exchange.)\n30% of the STX forwarded by miners goes into a special wallet reserved for the city to use––perhaps to create new public spaces for developments, recruit crypto founders, make improvements to infrastructure, or host city events.\nThe remaining 70% of STX goes to the CityCoin holders who choose to stack their CityCoins. Stacking requires that holders lock their CityCoins for a certain time to earn their STX rewards. Holders can then further stack that STX to generate Bitcoin rewards for themselves.\nThis system allows hodlers to earn Bitcoin and Stacks yield while simultaneously generating crypto to fund their city.\nWhy You Should Collect CityCoins\nMunicipal pride is just one reason to invest in your city's coin. In fact, you don't even need to live in the city to collect its token and make life better for its residents while earning yield for yourself. Mining a CityCoin gives the city resources that could potentially replace the budget or significantly contribute to expanded funding. It unlocks new fundraising methods for the city which will be directly supported by the community and investors.\nEach city in the CityCoins ecosystem has a wallet reserved for it. The mayor of a city may elect at any time to #pickupthebag and accept the reserved wallet to access the treasury for use by the city.\nThe possibilities for CityCoins are endless. Since they're programmable, we expect developers to create apps that use them for access, trading, lending, and smart contracts execution. The more people use them, the higher the rewards, and the more likely others will join in.\nResidents could also get a break on their municipal tax bill as reward for signaling support for their city. CityCoin miners are, after all, indirectly contributing sending 30% of their mining yield straight to their city's wallet. It's not far-fetched to imagine that an mining contributions could become larger than the annual tax the city might collect from them.\nFor students, paying tuition to your local college or public university in CityCoin could bring a discount. CityCoins could be distributed to the city's most needy citizens, or deposited in tax-free or reduced tax liability accounts for children as a way to secure their future.\nAs the utility of CityCoins grows, and the incentive for owning CityCoin increases accordingly, the possibilities grow ever more exciting.\nThe Magic City Paves The Way\nStarting at 3PM EDT on June 8, 2021, you can begin mining MiamiCoin.\nWhy the Magic City? Well, Miami has long been a center of culture and innovation in the States. In the last year, it's taken center stage as a technical powerhouse among major US cities, particularly in the realm of crypto and blockchain technology. Innovators have swarmed the city under the recognition of strong network effects, a supportive government, and a culture defined by constant evolution and disruption.\nWe couldn't think of a better place to debut CityCoins.", "document_type": "major_use_case", "categories": ["Title", "Applicable Date(s)", "Type", "Category", "Main Participant's Name", "Main Participant's Website", "Main Participant's Sector", "Main Participant's Details", "Involved Entity's Name", "Involved Entity's Website", "Details"], "answer_list": ["The World's First CityCoin, MiamiCoin Announced", "2021-06-03T00:00:00", "business", "crypto currency", "Freehold", "https://www.joinfreehold.com/", "financials", "Freehold is a community development company meant to incentivize crypto holders to actively participate in education and building activities", "-", "-", "CityCoins are powered by Stacks:CityCoins like $MIA are mined by forwarding Stacks tokens (STX) into a CityCoin's smart contract.30% of the STX forwarded by miners goes into a special wallet reserved for the city to use, to create new public spaces for developments, recruit crypto founders, make improvements to infrastructure, or host city events.The remaining 70% of STX goes to the CityCoin holders who choose to stack their CityCoins.

CertiK Chain is a cross-chain, delegated proof-of-stake blockchain that aims to provide the infrastructure for decentralized applications to interact with provable security.\nWhat are the use cases of CertiK (CTK)?\nCTK has a variety of use cases, from being used as gas for smart contracts, staking for PoS consensus, rewards for participating in the Security Oracle network, collateral and reimbursements through CertiKShield, as well as voting by decentralized governance.\nWith CTK, holders can earn yield and enable insurance-like coverage through CertiKShield, whilst being able to transact freely, transparently, and in a cost-effective manner on the CertiK Chain.\nWhat are the advantages of CertiK Chain?\nCertiK Chain's ecosystem is compostable into cross-chain assets to strengthen security across networks.\nSecurity Oracles\nBuilt on CertiK Chain, the Security Oracles establish a decentralized bridge between on-chain transactions and real-time security checks, providing up-to-date security scores to measure the risk of each contract. These security scores are available on-chain and compatible across protocols, enabling detailed security expertise to integrate into smart contracts of any protocol.\nCertiKShield This alternative to insurance provides a decentralized, on-chain pool of funds for reimbursing lost or stolen assets. The CertiKShield economy enables crypto holders to obtain protections by distributing purchase fees to CTK stakers who provide their assets as collateral. By utilizing security insights from the Security Oracles, smart contract risks can be more transparent for all parties involved.\nThe Security Oracle and CertiKShield are publicly available on the Security Leaderboard at certik.org.\nWhere can I purchase CTK?\nCTK is now available for trading on Liquid exchange.

By utilizing \"prop-tech\" — a tech solution combining blockchain with real estate development — business development can be expanded. The first service product offered is \"AuctionOK\", an online real estate auction service based on blockchain. This product is aiming to solve the various inconveniences of the existing offline-based real estate auction system. A patent application has been filed to provide an online, non-face-to-face real estate auction service using blockchain.\nOnline real estate auctions lower the entry barrier for customers to participate in online real estate auctions and thus contribute to the expansion of this field.\nQuestions 2 :\nDoes Landbox has its own token? Then can you explain about the tokenomics and use-cases of this token ?\nEtham :\nYes. We do! The name of token is LAND.\nFollowing is the token usage.\n· Rewards in accordance with Auction OK's inquiry/answer/curation/content sharing.\n· Auction OK real estate expert service payment.\n· As the platform currency, LAND Token may be paid by users to access third party projects which they have connected with on the platform\n· Holders of LAND Token will be entitled to tiered membership benefits.\n· LAND Token is accepted as the platform currency by the platform when a user accesses services available on the LANDBOX Platform, for example real estate brokerage, appraisal or information services.\nThose are in our whitepaper. We are brainstorming more stuff for the future as well.\nQuestions 3 :\nWhat is Landbox Vision for the future of its Project ?\nEtham :\nLandbox was founded to fundamentally improve the old way of investing in real estate. Landbox is a blockchain-based global real estate investment information sharing platform that connects real estate information and investors. Blockchain, which is immune to data forgery and has strong data transparency, can solve the existing problems of the lack of transparency, trust, and fairness, in real estate transactions.\nStarting with our first service, \"Auction Ok\" — an online real estate auction service based on blockchain — Landbox dreams of a new \"comprehensive real estate investment ecosystem\", that provides customers everything from indirect real estate investment products, and lifestyle & education content.\nSegment 2 : Questions From Twitter\nQuestions 1 :\nFrom @TheShadowJK_1\nOne of the business models Landbox has proposed is co-investment for land clearing gains. How will this co-investment model work? What are the steps to bring together investors interested in the same project? How will fairness and equity of returns be ensured?\nEtham :\nCo-investing is our vision but right now, we are focusing on the prop-tech not investment itself. Co-investing is quite hard for crypto project since most of method will fall into STO. We are utility token. However, we are focusing on giving the benefits of the real estate development to our users.\nQuestions 2 :\nFrom @QuinnJosephine4\nHow is landbox development going? Can you describe in detail current development efforts, market expansion plans, expected applications, and when will they become commercially available\nEtham :\nDevelopment of Auction OK is in beta phase. We are planning to launch official version on June or July. We soon have more partnership with other real estate and prop tech companies. It will bring the users onto our platform. Also, development of Auction OK school is on going right now. We are expecting it to launch in this year or early next year.\nQuestions 3 :\nFrom @dani_dani23\nOne of the important features in a project is the use cases of its native token. My question is, what are the different use cases of $LAND? What advantages does $LAND have for real estate investor users? And what role does $LAND play in real estate auctions?\nEtham :\nAs I explained in the previous question, LAND token is utility token. Right now, LAND is Auction Ok is not directly connected but we are developing more usage for it.\nFor now, following is the token usage.\n· Rewards in accordance with Auction OK's inquiry/answer/curation/content sharing.\n· Auction OK real estate expert service payment.\n· As the platform currency, LAND Token may be paid by users to access third party projects which they have connected with on the platform\n· Holders of LAND Token will be entitled to tiered membership benefits.\n· LAND Token is accepted as the platform currency by the platform when a user accesses services available on the LANDBOX Platform, for example real estate brokerage, appraisal or information services.\nThose are in our whitepaper. We are brainstorming more stuff for the future as well.\nQuestions 4 :\nFrom @deminfur\nLandBox's Business Model is based on a remote real-case education platform and real estate investment platform, how do you plan to optimize real-case transactions in a smart-digital way that includes blockchain?\nEtham :\nAgain, we are not using blockchain as real estate transactions. But Yes, blockchain is key for the trust in the Auction Platform.\n\"method for providing contactless real estate auction service using block chain.\" The patent technology allows the encryption of auction bids and the storage and management of such information on a blockchain network, which prevents unauthorized manipulation of the bids entered online. By providing a contactless blockchain property platform, this technology also significantly eliminates the inconvenience of conventional auction system which requires bidders to be present at each bid site.\nQuestions 5 :\nFrom @dani_dani23\nI was reading on your website about daily savings with Bitcoin and the Land Saving service. What is the purpose of this? How would it benefit real estate buyer/seller users? And how is the process of activating or requesting such protocol or service?\nEtham :\nBit-saving service is not our main focus but we are developing its service as we speak. This is one of the way to help new users to invest into crypto currencies. The method is basically DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) investment into BTC and ETH. The app will be launched in a month or two. We will announce when its ready.\nSegment 3 : Questions From Member Crypto Zyte Community\nQuestions 1 :\nFrom @Foranar\n🔘Is the platform safe to Invest? How strong is your security? Have you already done an audit of the platform?\nEtham :\nI am not sure what do you mean by security? Yes our platform is quite secure. If you are talking about LAND token, yes we did get security audit by Certik. 🙂\nQuestions 2 :\nFrom @Backagai\nWhat are your upcoming plans and goals? Do you have any top priorities for 2021 in roadmap?\nEtham :\nTop priority is … haha there are many, first one is our development ofcoz. second, partnetships and listing. We are working hard for LAND. 🙂\nQuestions 3 :\nFrom @Backagai\nWhen THE BEAR MARKET COMES\nWILL your token PROBABLY DUMP\nAre you prepared for this bear market?\nHow will you handle the panic of your Investors?\nEtham :\nGood question. In the bear market, as you know token projects will dump. and yes we are prepared. 🙂 it does not mean we will do something about price. we are focusing on BUILDING. If we build and archive the goal that we are setting, we will survive and as you know already, surviving crypto is the strong ones.\nQuestions 4 :\nFrom @Backagai\nWhat wallet does your project support or do you have your own wallet?\nEtham :\nWe are ERC20 token. and BSC token. So any Ether wallet will support our token.\nQuestions 5 :\nFrom @gundujbay\nIs your project global or local? Can anyone from anywhere in the world use your services? Are there any restrictions on your use of the Services??\nEtham :\nThe platform is now starting as local service since we do have regulations. We will expend to global in the future but not to global …. we need to expend county by county.\nRead more about Landbox at the link below :\nOfficial Website : https://landbox.io/\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/Landbox_\nMedium : https://medium.com/@Landbox-news\nTelegram : https://t.me/Landtoken_en", "document_type": "ir_event", "categories": ["IR Activity Type", "Applicable Date(s)", "Online event", "Offline event Location", "Offline event Address", "Purpose", "Details", "Sponsorships Name", "Sponsorships Details", "Related Disclosure"], "answer_list": ["ama: ", "2021-05-25T14:00:00 ~ ", "https://t.me/CryptoZyteCommunity", "-", "-", "Ask Me Anything ( AMA ) Series #50 Crypto Zyte x Landbox", "TitleAMA Crypto Zyte X LandboxDate and Time25 May 2021 2:00 PM UTCProgram1.

From this \"big wave\", new goods and services such as sharing economies like car dispatch services, automatic driving and robotics industry using AI, as well as checkout-free unmanned convenience stores are born.Platformers who monopolize informationMany of today's network services are provided by giant platformers such as GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon). In return for using the service for free, we pass personal data such as behavior history which we as users should own, to the platformer. In such a way, a large amount of data exchanged from service contacts such as communication networks and applications are exclusively collected by the platformer's centralized system, managed and analyzed, and used for various purposes.Who owns our data?However, there have been numerous incidents in which data that,we believe, should be managed safely is quite easily leaked due to cyber-attacks, system defects, and human mistakes. In addition, there have been cases where data tracked, collected and analyzed from networks is misused to deliver ads or clever contents that can lead you to websites you didn't originally want. The fast-growing giant platformers are now at a major turning point in their strategiesThe basic idea of \"DATA DEMOCRACY\"Our basic idea is to return personal data to the hands of the individual it belongs to, and to realize \"democratization of data\" that is distributed and managed in a secure way. The \"Jasmy IoT Platform\" will be developed based on this idea. Based on a solid relationship of trust between companies and customers on the platform, we will create an environment where data can be exchanged securely as valuables, and build a new era of information, a \"new era of user-oriented information\".

FTX Exchange mainly treats derivative tokens, leverage tokens and over-the-counter (OTC). FTX Exchange was established in April 2021 by Alameda Research, a virtual asset trading firm located in Hong Kong, which has shown rapid growth by launching a variety of innovative products other than usual derivatives such as futures and options. Alameda Research was founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, a former Wall Street trading company, and it has rapidly emerged as a major influential figure in the virtual asset trading industry thanks to the success of the FTX Exchange.\nFTX's major services focus on USDT-collateralized trades, introducing a number of innovative and diverse trading products that have not been seen from existing virtual asset exchanges. FTX allows trading of various products including futures contracts betting on Bitcoin hash power trends or shitcoin indexes, Trump coin for betting on the result of the US presidential election and unlisted stock coins. FTX is expanding its outreach to the field of spot exchange, recently launching fiat currency deposit and withdrawal services.\nThe benefits that FTT holders can enjoy are classified into four categories as follows: First, they can benefit from discounted fees for the trading via FTX Exchange. In addition to transaction fees, rewards with higher interest rates are provided if the FTT users successfully recruit new traders to the FTX exchange.

This means that the entire blockchain is roughly 22kb in size, equivalent to the size of a few tweets. Mina thus provides a low barrier to entry to those who wish to operate a node and validate transactions.\nMina's blockchain is built to maintain its size, regardless of the amount of people accessing it or its years of transaction history, using a technology called zero knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs). zk-SNARKs are micro-crypto certificates stored by nodes and used to verify transactions in a private and efficient manner, allowing nodes to not have to store the entire chain.\nMina is a proof-of-stake protocol for programmable payments, apps, permissionless privacy and is secured cryptographically. Its MINA cryptocurrency can be used by holders to help govern the ecosystem and for payments within the applications.\nOne of the most anticipated projects of the industry to date, Mina raised a total of $18.75 million during its token sale on Coinlist in only four hours.

When you deposit MINA to Kraken we generate a new MINA address for you and the MINA blockchain automatically takes 1 MINA from your deposit amount as the creation fee.

Moreover, this will provide a new outlet for users to interact through the gamified metaverse experience via the Injective Protocol Center in the Dvision Network.\nBackground\nIf you've been following trends in the NFT industry or are familiar with the ongoing digital art movement, you may have heard about the Burnt Banksy artwork, which was initiated by anonymous group Burnt Banksy and was supported by Injective Protocol. This event established a unique bridge between NFTs and physical art itself. The burnt piece of artwork titled Morons (White) was later sold as an NFT representing its digital reincarnation for a whopping $380,000 and the event itself was covered by international media such as the New Yorker and Forbes.\nThe mission of the Injective community has always been to provide unlimited access to all markets. NFTs fit well into this overall thesis as the goal is to continue pioneering access to new frontiers within DeFi. Injective has previously collaborated with SuperFarm to help launch a series of exclusive Injective NFTs as well.\nThe Metaverse Experience on Injective\nAs a part of this integration, Dvision Network will be powering the Injective Protocol Center, which will be customized specifically to interact with the community through the gamified social metaverse experience in the Dvision world. This will provide unprecedented opportunities for integration with the Injective community on a totally new scale and framework.\nThe Injective Protocol Center will be based on the VR-space, a non-fungible token (ERC-721), that represents a virtual piece of real estate inside of the Dvision metaverse. The supply of these virtual spaces will be limited to ensure that each will have its own unique location. By launching a virtual space, the Injective community will reach a new level of socialization in a gamified manner.\nYou can view the Injective Protocol Center here.\nNFT Derivatives\nThe importance of DeFi has rapidly been recognized by a global audience. Along with DeFi going mainstream, the concept of NFTs has evolved and continued to seep into the consciousness of the broader public. Dvision Network consistently explores new ways to enable the smoother and wider convergence of DeFi & NFTs, there are still a remarkable number of technical and conceptual aspects to be explored in this area.\nTo further expand the use cases for NFTs, community developers are exploring the idea of creating derivative instruments for the most liquid and precious NFT items available within the metaverse. Creating derivative instruments, or more specifically future contracts will break down the barriers for users who are not capable of directly participating in the sale of NFT items. This will be accomplished with users taking part in prediction markets for NFTs. The primary goal of this initiative is to facilitate the capitalization of NFT sale prices without requiring users to hold them.\nIn the near future, Injective will collaborate with Dvision to expand the creation of new derivatives. A series of NFT index products will also be launched that include the most liquid and attractive NFTs from different projects, including Dvision NFTs.\nStay tuned for more!\nAbout Dvision Network\nDvision Network provides a web-based, real-time, streaming, 3D virtual reality metaverse service so that users can easily experience metaverse contents, such as fairs and games. On the Dvision platform, anyone can easily create NFT items without any development-related expertise. Dvision's NFT trading system enables monetization by directly connecting creators and consumers without intermediaries. This serves to connect the virtual world to reality.\nAbout Injective\nInjective is the first cross-chain protocol built for decentralized finance applications. On the Injective exchange, anyone can access, create, and trade unlimited DeFi markets such as futures and perpetuals.

We are excited to initiate the staged roll-out of our highly anticipated wallet!\nThe wallet is the cornerstone of Maps.me 2.0 and represents a critical step towards the mass adoption of DeFi. It combines a number of moving pieces linking together the CeFi and DeFi worlds. It's critical to get this right to ensure successful roll-out stages. We are excited to have received positive feedback on it so far and continue working through constructive suggestions.\nAs you know, the Maps.me embedded wallet is a travel-oriented fiat wallet. As such, it is bound by the regulations and dynamics of traditional financial systems and the realm of fiat currency. The development of fundamental wallet components will be generally, and almost necessarily, more time intensive than what many are accustomed to in the Serum and Solana ecosystems.\nThe timing of the wallet's release stages also depends on the delivery of major credit card companies, corporate trustees, regulatory authorities, banking partners, and our other backend providers. Our partners play a key role in the creation of this ecosystem, and we're excited about building something great with them. We want to thank the Maps.me community for your patience, feedback, and continuing support. We are always listening to your feedback and taking them into account as we continue building out Maps.me 2.0.\nThe wallet is being released first to our waitlisted members across multiple stages, and then soon to the rest of the Maps.me community. Marco has also revealed a couple of wallet screenshots lately. Our young pup just couldn't contain himself! We can't blame him, and we are delighted to share more of our vision in this post.\nBuy MAPS Tokens from the App\nThe first feature that caught the eyes of our first beta testers was the ability to buy MAPS through the Maps.me wallet. In our whitepaper, we have detailed our vision of making MAPS a part of a rewards system, allowing users to earn points similar to airline miles or credit card points. You will also be able to guess how things operate under the hood.\nA new reward scheme for all Maps.me users!\nMAPS bought on the Maps.me wallet are \"buy-and-hold\" and, in the current conception of the Maps.me app, cannot be traded. Rather, by holding different levels of MAPS (i.e. staking) on the wallet, you can unlock various wallet features and become eligible to receive different levels of discounts and cashbacks. In this post, we'll discuss two of our favourite such features: eSIM data plans and hotel booking cashbacks.\neSIM Card\nCreating a convenient travel experience means the world to us. One feature focusing on streamlined travel is the introduction of eSIM packages directly through your wallet. eSIM (embedded SIM) cards allow you to activate a cellular plan without requiring a physical SIM card (as the eSIM is already embedded within your device). The convenience brought by eSIM capable devices is taking the world by storm, with staggering predictions for eSIM device growth. Maps.me is ready to leverage this functionality and redefine travel.\nYour ultimate travel companion is ready whenever you are.\nTravellers with eSIM supported devices will be able to purchase eSIM data plans through the Maps.me wallet for more than 100 countries. Say goodbye to swapping between multiple SIM cards when you travel. With the Maps.me wallet, you can take advantage of local data prices and avoid the headaches of expensive data plans at the airport, allowing you to stay connected at a fraction of the cost.\nHotel Booking and Cashbacks\nMaps.me is your ultimate travel companion for exploring the world, discovering new places, and even finding places to stay and rest. Maps.me can also help you get the best deals on accommodations and hotels, thanks to our cashback program through Booking.com.\nPlay and rest, all at your fingertips.\nBooking.com will provide cashbacks (of up to 10%) for bookings, depending on your MAPS holdings (whether you are a Bronze, Silver, or Gold premium member). This is just one way we are connecting travellers and businesses to a rich and rewarding travel experience. We are exploring further partnerships and new, exciting ways to bring a more immersive and financially-empowered experience to the Maps.me community.\nNext Steps\nIt's important to reiterate our unwavering commitment to releasing a high quality product to our users. With our feet deeply planted in CeFi and DeFi, details mean everything. Everything in our roadmap builds on itself; we are focused on getting it right.\nThroughout April, we have been beta testing our wallet with a select number of expert supporters before expanding our staged roll-out. Once again, we emphasize our preference not to make promises on deadlines, given how quickly things can change and complicate in the CeFi and DeFi worlds. We are focusing on the core of the app and resolving the necessary infrastructure issues to make sure everything works seamlessly and securely, so that Maps.me 2.0 is ready to serve millions of people and beyond.\nThank you again for all your patience and understanding along our journey.

While we believe Ethereum and its ecosystem have done amazing things (think Maker, Aave, Curve, Compound, Synthetix, …), we also believe that such solutions could thrive even more under a Bitcoin standard, scaled by the Stacks blockchain.\nMost of the money flowing into bitcoin is not optimally used. Bitcoin is not a rock that should be sitting idle. While bitcoin is protected by the most secure network on earth, the Bitcoin blockchain, the asset itself could be used in a more active way.\nArkadiko will enable your STX & bitcoin to be used for a variety of things, such as collateral to mint stablecoins, borrowing assets or lending out your STX and bitcoin for attractive returns. All of this happens without having to give up custody or the security and hashpower of the bitcoin blockchain. 🚀\nWhen launching later this year (mainnet after summer), you will be able to use Arkadiko for a myriad of use cases. Here's a sneak preview of what we have in mind:\nMint xUSD to purchase additional STX for stacking, increasing your stacking APY with another 35 to 50% while limiting downside risk. And don't worry, your collateral will be stacked by Arkadiko as well!\nStake DIKO 🍆 — the Arkadiko governance token. There will be 100 million DIKO in existence in the first five years, of which 50 million that can be earned by the ecosystem through staking. In the first 12 months, stakers can earn 25 million DIKO, where we are targeting APYs of 50% and more for early users. Farmers galore!\nTo incentivise xUSD creation in the early days, Arkadiko vaults will be eligible for some tasty DIKO as well, resulting in double incentives (mint xUSD -> receive DIKO -> stake DIKO -> receive more DIKO).\nLend or borrow bitcoin without bitcoin ever leaving the Bitcoin blockchain. The borrower deposits xUSD collateral (say 200% LTV) in the Arkadiko smart contract, which will act as an escrow. When the escrow signals that the xUSD arrived and is locked up, the lender can safely send the bitcoin to the borrower and signal to the escrow that the loan was successfully initiated by posting the TX ID of the bitcoin transaction. The escrow keeps track of the state in its smart contract. Should the price of bitcoin ever go below an agreed upon LTV, the xUSD collateral is simply released to the lender as a liquidation occurs. In normal circumstances, the bitcoin will be paid back by a certain block height, and the escrow releases the xUSD collateral back to the borrower, minus the borrowing cost. All of this is possible since Clarity, the Stacks smart contract language, can read Bitcoin state. One of the many advantages of this amazing little language.\nThe above is not too good to be true. It is simply true!\nWhat's Next?\nWe can't wait to launch Arkadiko and boost applications leveraging stablecoins and lending on Stacks! In the next few weeks, we will release information regarding the testnet launch, our amazing team, the platform, its usage, technical details, how it works, protocol governance, tokenomics details and community involvement opportunities.\nOh, and by the way.. we will be launching our testnet on June 16th, so it won't be long!\nWe believe in fair launches. Open-source protocols such as Arkadiko should be community owned and driven. That's why 50% of all DIKO will be reserved for the ecosystem around Arkadiko to thrive. Arkadiko is built by DeFi users for DeFi users. If you have other use cases in mind, get involved on Twitter or Discord.

The BTC-CRV, ETH-CRV, and USDT-CRV markets are now open for trading!Bittrex Global TeamFollowMay 26 · 2 min readDisclaimer: The below information is provided directly from the token team.

The DAO will allow liquidity providers to take decisions on adding new pools, changing pool parameters, adding CRV incentives and many other aspects of the Curve protocol.Those resources aim to help new and existing users to become familiar with the Curve protocol, the Curve DAO and the CRV token.The easiest way to understand Curve is to see it as an exchange. Its main goal is to let users and other decentralised protocols exchange stablecoins (DAI to USDC for example) through it with low fees and low slippage. Unlike exchanges out there that match a buyer and a seller, the behaviour of Curve is different, it uses liquidity pools like Uniswap. To achieve this, Curve needs liquidity (tokens) which is rewarded by those who provide it.Curve is non-custodial meaning the Curve developers do not have access to your tokens.Why has Curve grown so quickly?Stable coins have become an inherent part of cryptocurrency for a long time but they now come in many different flavours (DAI, TUSD, sUSD, bUSD, USDC and so on) which means there is a much bigger need for crypto users to move from a stable coin to another. Centralised exchanges tend to have high fees which are problematic for those trying to move from a stable coin to another. As a result, Curve.fi has become the best place to exchange stable coins because of its low fees and low slippage.Trade BTC-CURVE, ETH-CURVE, USDT-CURVE now at: global.bittrex.comWe work hard to make sure Bittrex Global customers have the best possible user experience:Deposit with your VISA debit or credit card and trade today!

Users can freely convert tokens according to their own needs.\nAbout ChainSwap\nChainSwap is a cross-chain asset bridge & application hub for smart chains. ChainSwap allows projects to seamlessly bridge between ETH, BSC and HECO. In the future ChainSwap will be integrating chains and provide full cross-chain solutions between BTC, DOT, SOL and more.\n📖A Tutorial on How to Convert TSHP ERC-20 to TSHP BEP-20 Step by Step.\n👉Firstly, Preparatory Work.\n1. Install the MetaMask Wallet and Deposit TSHP Tokens.\nBefore starting the ChainSwap cross-chain, we recommend installing the MetaMask wallet extensions in Chrome browser. After the wallet has been installed and your account is created, deposit your TSHP ERC-20 tokens to your wallet address.\nPlease note that you need to manually add TSHP tokens to the MetaMask wallet to display your balance. Click \"Add Token\" on the wallet page, then click \"Custom Token\", and enter the contract address of TSHP ERC-20 is: 0x525794473f7ab5715c81d06d10f52d11cc052804\nClick \"Next\" and then click \"Add Token\".\n2. Manually Add the BSC Network to the MetaMask Wallet.\nThe default network of MetaMask wallet is Ethereum Mainnet, click the network drop-down list and click \"Custom RPC\" to manually add a new network with the following parameters, then click \"Save\" .\nNetwork Name: BSC\nNew RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/\nChain ID: 56\nSymbol: BNB\nBlock Explorer URL: https://bscscan.com\n👉Secondly, Complete TSHP cross-chain from Ethereum network to BSC network.\n1. Connect the Wallet\n1.1 Open the website: https://exchange.chainswap.com/, connect your MetaMask wallet, click the purple button \"Connect Wallet\" which on the top right corner or the middle of the web page.\n1.2 After clicking the button, a wallet options window pops up and we suggest you select the MetaMask wallet.\n1.3 You need to find the MetaMask wallet Chrome extension in the upper right corner of Chrome browser, then click the MetaMask icon, and a prompt will pop up (as shown below). Select the wallet account that contains TSHP tokens. Click \"Next\" to proceed forward; then click \"Connect\" to complete the wallet connection.\n2. For the first cross-chain execution, the \"Approve\" function of the contract is called to grant the permission to allow ChainSwap withdraw TSHP and automate transactions for you.\n2.1 On the Chainswap homepage, you are supposed to find TSHP in the token drop-down list and select it. Cross-chain setting: \"From\" is ETH, \"To\" is BSC, then click \"Approve\" to grant the permission to allow ChainSwap withdraw TSHP and automate transactions for you.\n2.2 a message will prompt on MetaMask in the upper right corner of the page, open it and click \"Confirm\" to allow the site to withdraw and trade the TSHP. (The screenshot showed below is for your reference only, that the transaction fee was $8.76(the transaction fee may changes automatically in real time according to the network difficulty)\n2.3 Go back to the Cross Chain Bridge page, you can see that it's in the state of Approving. (If you have been caught in this state for a long time, it is recommended that you can enter the MetaMask wallet and find the \"Approve\" in the queue of \"Activity\" to check it. If it is still pending, click \"Speed Up\" to add some gas fee.)\n3. Congrats! 🎉After Approved successfully, let's convert TSHP ERC-20 into TSHP BEP-20 token now!\n3.1 The button \"Approve\" changes to \"Deposit in ETH Chain\", now you are supposed to click this button.\n3.2 Click \"Confirm\" in the pop-up window, and it will automatically turns to the wallet page of MetaMask.\n3.3 As the screenshot showed below, the total Gas Fee and service charge of cross chain is 0.005764ETH, which is about $15.64, for your reference only. And you are supposed to click \"Confirm\". (If your transaction is in the state of pending for a long time, you are recommended to speed it up as mentioned in Step 2.3 above.)\n3.4 Now your TSHP ERC-20 tokens have been locked into an appointed address belong to ChainSwap, and then click \"Claim List\" to claim the corresponding number of TSHP BEP-20 tokens.\n3.5 Now in the Claim List, you are supposed to select TSHP.\n3.6 Click \"Claim\".\n3.7 Now the wallet window will pop up automatically, and you need to cilck \"Switch Network\" to allow the wallet to Switch from ETH Network to BSC Network.\n3.8 After the wallet network switched to BSC, click \"Withdraw on BSC Chain\".\n3.9 While the wallet page pops up again, click \"Confirm\" to complete the conversion from TSHP ERC-20 tokens to TSHP BEP-20 tokens.\nFor now, the conversion from TSHP ERC-20 to TSHP BEP-20 has been completed. While TSHP will not automatically appear in the wallet balance, so we need to manually add the tokens.\n4. Add Tokens Manually\nClick \"Add Token\" on the MetaMask wallet, and click \"Custom Token\". Then entering the contract address of TSHP BEP-20: 0x61b5ebb791a71af7548755f88971138064037d8f\nClick \"Next\" and then click \"Add Token\".\nAt this point, you have successfully added the TSHP BEP-20 tokens, and the amount of TSHP assets is visible in your wallet balance.\nTutorial of TSHP Switch from BSC to Ethereum.\nYou can do the reverse switch from BSC network back to the Ethereum network referring to the steps above.\nAbout 12Ships\n12Ships is a blockchain platform which focuses on cryptocurrency mining and staking.

We're hiring aggressively to bolster our ranks with missionaries.\nAxie is a genre-defining digital nation that's jump-starting a mass migration towards NFT gaming.\nIf you'd like to learn about using NFTs in games, reach out to us at publishing@skymavis.com.\nSometimes you're so early to a market that you feel like you're building for yourself and a few close friends. When Axie was born 3 years ago, almost nobody cared or understood what an NFT was.\nOur office in 2018. Bear market grinding is imprinted in our culture.\nWe knew most of our players by name and Axie Discord felt like an intimate chat by campfire. How things have changed!\nIn retrospect, this was a crucial rite of passage for us and our battle-hardened community. It was dark and cold but the scar tissue is our secret weapon and that environment can never be recreated. In the beginning, we attracted a community of missionaries more interested in changing gaming than quick money.\nThese are our core beliefs:\nNFTs enable new types of games: just as mobile gaming unlocked new design space and player archetypes, so too will NFT games. These games won't look like the games of the past and will require an entirely new perspective and skillset to build.\nGamers crave property rights: property rights incentivize players to act more like founders and employees rather than users. These rights include: being able to sell your game assets to anyone in the world, earning liquid tokens for playing/contributing, and being able to own a piece of the game you're playing.\nPlay-to-earn: unlocks new types of work around digital Metaverse economies, just as Uber, AirBNB, and DoorDash created new types of jobs and professions.\n✨A New Age\nFrom humble beginnings, Axie has grown to be the largest NFT gaming ecosystem with the metrics to prove it:\nOver 41,000 daily active users + 45,000+ Axie holders\nOver 15 M USD in monthly NFT volume.\nA fully diluted market cap of over 2 Billion USD.\nThe #1 NFT game and one of the most used applications on Ethereum.\nThis is just the beginning of a long and fascinating journey. The next steps involve:\nLowering barriers to entry. It's still too hard to get started with NFT games. So we've built Ronin, an Ethereum sidechain tailor-made to scale Axie Infinity and other digital nations moving forward.\nMore fun. We've already started hiring traditional game developers. Tesla was able to acquire the skills they lacked because their vision was huge and acted as a magnet for talent. Why wait for triple AAA game studios to catch on when we can simply hire their star talent? Scaling play to earn. As an NFT game grows its community, advertisers and sponsors will start injecting capital into these ecosystems, making them even more attractive to gamers. This means that NFT games will benefit from network effects in a way that games have never been able to before.\n🛡️ The Battle to Come\nNFTs with utility and fun baked into them are an inevitable part of the future.\nSo far, we've been underfunded. We've been scrappy and this will always be a part of our DNA. Thankfully, this new funding round will allow us to be more aggressive with our hiring and our growth experiments. We anticipate Axie scaling to millions of users through:\nA world class creator program that blends the best referral systems ever created and adds a touch of blockchain magic.\nFree to play-to-earn will unlock millions of new users who will try Axie for the fun before making any economic decisions. Hundreds of thousands of users try to play Axie each month but give up due to all the steps.\nUser generated content will unleash the true potential of Axie. In the future, Sky Mavis will be one of many organizations building on top of Axie and Ronin. Axie will become a hive mind not limited by the ideas of a single central team.\nAxie's success will act as a magnet to attract more builders to NFT gaming. We'll help these pioneers launch and scale their projects both technically using Ronin and by introducing our peerless community to their products.\nThis is the future we see ahead. It's still so early, especially for NFT games which we believe require the most work but also have the largest potential.\nTo help summon this future we're thrilled to share that we've raised 7.5 M USD through an amazing group of new community members.\nWe're hiring gritty, gifted, and persuasive missionaries to help us in this epic quest.\nApply Now\nHere are some quotes from our awesome group of investors:\n\"Axie Infinity is at the intersection of gaming and NFTs, two of the fastest growing and most promising cryptocurrency use cases. With over 30,000 daily active users, they have proven product-market fit and an incredibly passionate community. We're excited to support Sky Mavis as they scale to the next 300,000 and then 3 million users.\"\n- Ari Paul, CIO at Blocktower Capital\n\"The Sky Mavis team is pioneering community owned games. They have fostered a community of committed players because of their ability to provide true economic freedom within their ecosystem. We are thrilled to be investors in them and to be supporting their quest to showcase the power of player ownership.\"\n- Jason Chapman, Partner at Konvoy\n\"Sitting at the intersection of digital play, property ownership, and the future of work—Axie Infinity is one of the most fascinating and ambitious gaming projects in the world. With over 30k DAUs and 40k Axie holders, and no signs of slowing down, we're witnessing a powerful, community-run digital nation form in real time. We are excited to partner with the stellar team at Sky Mavis as they scale Axie Infinity over the next decade.\"\n- Collab + Currency's Derek Schloss and Stephen McKeon\nI think Axie is an amazing platform. It's fun and engaging. It's a game you want to play for hours on end. Add the Axie economy and you have something special. I'm excited to be part of it.\n- Mark Cuban\n\"We are excited to support the Sky Mavis team as they continue to build category defining games such as Axie Infinity and explore the intersection between gaming, social and digital ownership.

This action has been planned since the creation of Proton and will allow us to continue pouring our efforts into developing the Proton ecosystem without being restrained by slower, less-flexible blockchains. Of the XPR that we are moving over to the Proton blockchain, we will be locking 1 billion XPR into a 365-day long staking contract, and 2 billion XPR into a 90-day long staking contract.\nThe Proton-to-Ethereum Bridge\nWhile the Proton-to-Ethereum bridge remains open for the everyday user, we will be rarely utilizing this bridge as a company. We have full confidence in the ecosystem that we are rapidly building, and we find few reasons to use XPR outside of this ecosystem. Moving forward, the block rewards paid out to short stakers, block producers, and the governing council will be reduced from 5% to 3%, dialing back the rate at which new Proton enters the ecosystem.\nAs a refresher: XPR that is wrapped in Ethereum has the constraints of the Ethereum blockchain – meaning high gas fees and long transaction times. Any XPR that is held on the Proton blockchain enjoys no gas fees, instant transactions, and easy access to every inch of the Proton ecosystem.\nWhat this means for LOAN\nRecently, we reached out to our community to determine what they thought would be the best course of action for how Metallicus and its founders should use the LOAN received via the upcoming airdrop. We believe that community is at the heart of every successful cryptocurrency project, and we want to give our community more control as Proton becomes increasingly decentralized. You made your voices heard, and the votes are in! We will be giving up all voting rights of the LOAN tokens that we receive, ensuring that the governance model remains more decentralized.\nBy securing all company-held XPR on the Proton blockchain, we will also be reserving our resulting stake of the upcoming LOAN airdrop to Proton holders by locking a portion of this XPR into a long staking contract. As a reminder, wallets that hold XPR at the time of the LOAN snapshot and airdrop will receive LOAN according to the amount of XPR that is held and the manner in which that XPR is held. If you hold XPR in your wallet, you receive a 1:1 ratio of XPR-to-LOAN; if you hold XPR in a 365 day long staking contract, you receive a 30:1 ratio of XPR-to-LOAN. You can read more about the various ratios and what this airdrop means here.\nReceiving a large stake of LOAN from this upcoming airdrop ensures the company is able to provide sufficient liquidity for LOAN transactions on Proton Swap. Additionally, we will be able to use this LOAN to fund hackathons, bounties, and other activities that would encourage the accelerated development of Proton blockchain and the Proton Lend protocol.\nBringing XPR home to the Proton blockchain serves as a strong signal of our continued commitment to developing this growing ecosystem into a world-class enterprise-ready and user-friendly cryptocurrency environment. Proton is the perfect blockchain to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance, and we can't wait to show the world all of the things that Proton can do.\nWelcome to Proton, we're glad you're here.", "document_type": "token_swap", "categories": ["Applicable Date(s)", "Announcement Type", "Purpose of token swap", "Other relevant information", "Token Name", "Swap Amount (Tokens)", "Supporting Exchange's Name", "Supporting Exchange's URL"], "answer_list": ["2021-06-03T00:00:00", "announcing_intentions", "The Proton team will be moving all company-held XPR (ERC-20 wrapped version) off of the Ethereum blockchain and onto the Proton blockchain where it belongs.

For more information, see the Protocol 17 Improvements blog post or the developer documentation. The network upgrade to Protocol 17 required the assent of validators, who vote for and agree to a new protocol version just like they vote for and agree to apply transaction sets to the ledger. If you're interested in participating in future votes, you can run your own validating node, no permission required. For more on network governance, see the Upgrading the Network doc.\nIt takes a lot of coordination to pull off a major protocol change, and we appreciate the diligence, patience, and effort everyone in the ecosystem put in to prepare.

Driving industry firsts with leading partnerships\nAs the first bank in the Sultanate of Oman to join our global payments network, RippleNet, BankDhofar will connect with leading Indian private sector bank IndusInd Bank to drive real-time payments into India. This partnership will enable cross-border transactions made via the BankDhofar Mobile Banking App to be processed instantly, reliably, cost-effectively and with end-to-end visibility anywhere in the world.\nThis first-of-its-kind service in Oman is more important now than ever before as India continues to be the top remittance receiving country in the world. BankDhofar customers will be able to transfer up to OMR 1,000 (~approx $2,600), to deposit accounts in India instantly through BankDhofar's Mobile Banking App. \"More than ever, people need to send money to loved ones abroad,\" said Navin Gupta, Managing Director of South Asia and MENA. \"Ripple is excited to partner with BankDhofar and IndusInd Bank to enhance the cross-border payments experience from Oman to India to be easier, cheaper and more reliable with blockchain technology.\" \"At BankDhofar, we are always putting digital solutions and innovation at the core of our strategy to improve the experience of our customers.\" said Abu Baker Karim Al Balushi, Head of Digital Banking at BankDhofar. \"This service will enable BankDhofar to be in a leading position to offer a range of new products and instant payment services. We look forward to activating the service to other countries across the world.\"\nBuilding credibility with blockchain technology\nThe partnership with Ripple enables BankDhofar to improve its customers' satisfaction through maximizing operations efficiency, security and transparency. Using RippleNet has also reaffirmed BankDhofar's position as a bank in the Sultanate that continues to innovate, further evidenced when it joined the leading blockchain consortium BankChain as the first bank in the Sultanate to support best practices and solutions in blockchain.\nOur expansion into the Sultanate of Oman with BankDhofar is a step in the right direction to enabling interoperable cross-border payments, and to building a more financially inclusive future.\nRippleNet leverages blockchain technology to help partners across a global network accelerate their business performance and scale. It delivers a superior end-customer experience, simplified network partnering, liquidity management solutions, lines of credit, and a state-of-the-art infrastructure that enables real-time payments.

The article discusses how the largest entertainment media network and the biggest blockchain infrastructure in Vietnam will solve the problem of motivating, encouraging users, and reducing advertisements annoyance.\nOriginal article in Vietnamese published by CafeBiz:\nhttps://m.cafebiz.vn/kardiachain-cung-yeah1-phat-trien-nen-tang-giai-tri-moi-tang-loi-ich-cho-nguoi-dung-20210511162827351.chn\nViewers, channel creators, even advertisers can now gain more benefits on a mutual social networking platform powered by blockchain technology.\nAre Youtube/Social Network users' rights neglected?\nIn the booming Industrial Revolution 4.0, Youtube is still the dominant force in the digital entertainment force. The platform remains the world's largest video sharing platform and the world's second-largest social network in terms of active users. On average, people spend billions of hours watching videos on YouTube daily.\nIt is worth mentioning that the current state of advertising on Youtube is \"bombing\" viewers. Ads usually appear suddenly with repetitive nature. Most of the ads introduce inappropriate products, which annoys all viewers to grab their attention.\nThe YouTube platform currently offers five main types of ad placement, three of which appear directly in videos, including banner ads, skippable ads, and non-skippable ads. They can be placed at the beginning, at the end, or any preferable point by the channel owner, or according to Google's automatic algorithm. However, in reality, the algorithm works differently from how it is stated. And obviously, free users are forced to view the ads unless users are willing to pay for premium service, which is only available in some countries.\nAs a result, end-users are now besieged by advertisements, partially from revenue pressure by both the platform and the content creators themselves. The platform sets ads to be repetitive, while creators enable as many advertising options as possible to profit and cover production costs. Moreover, the viewers do not receive actual values from these ads bombardment despite their commitment to the platform.\nThe \"win-win\" solution for all parties.\nRegarding the concerns about optimizing benefits for users in participating in any social networking platforms, KardiaChain has formed a partnership with Yeah1 Group, the largest entertainment media network in Vietnam. The collaboration aims to solve the \"earning\" problem for end-users and encourage them to persevere with the ad placement while watching their favorite content.\nKardiaChain will provide blockchain technology solutions including:\nTokenisation of a video-sharing social network platform to watch videos and live streams from Yeah1's celebrity roster, KOLs, and influencers.\nKOL's NFT: Users can use KAI to initiate a smart contract in the NFT of their favourite KOLs to either trade KOL's merchandise, collectibles, or require services according to the KOL's skill set.\nCrowdfunding to develop new projects and promote new talents.\nOn the other hand, content creators' major income source comes from advertising delivered by the platform they operate on or via their owned sponsorship deals based on their reputation. However, this is a long-overdue process, and creators occasionally have to work free of charge to build up their influence. Even advertisers do not gain their desired return of investment despite spending vast amounts of resources.\nTo put it simply, the implementation of blockchain technology will create a \"smart economy\" for the entertainment industry. All parties, including viewers, content creators, or advertisers, will get true benefits and value based on a seamless, transparent data flow.\nKardiaChain's representative, CTO & Co-Founder Huy Nguyen, said: \"With the blockchain technology platform, KardiaChain expects all participants in the value chain to have certain benefits, based on their contributions. Those values are publicly shown, transparent, and are the foundation for a long-lasting connection. We believe that when the project is deployed on a large scale, Vietnamese users will have more opportunities to choose the right entertainment channel to both enjoy and earn without any annoyance.\"\nThe power resonance between a pioneer interoperable technology platform and a multi-channel powerhouse will create a new status quo on the market.

This post will provide a layperson's overview of this project.\nBackground\nThe FIO Protocol is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) blockchain. Block producers are elected by the vote of FIO Token holders who may vote directly or proxy their vote to other FIO accounts. The FIO token itself is a utility token used to pay fees on the FIO blockchain such as registration of FIO Addresses and FIO Domains. A core element of the FIO blockchain model is that those who contribute to the protocol's success participate in the value created by the FIO Protocol blockchain. Block producers, for example, receive the largest portion of the fees paid to the FIO blockchain by users to support them in securing the chain. Technology providers that integrate the FIO Protocol receive a portion of the FIO token fees paid to the FIO chain from within their product. But, todate, users who hold FIO Tokens and participate in the critical role of chain governance do not participate in the economic success of the FIO blockchain.\nPurpose\nThe goal of the FIO Staking FIP is to enable users who hold FIO Tokens and who participate in governance by voting or proxying their tokens to also participate in the economic success of the decentralized FIO Protocol blockchain which they are enabling by holding and voting/proxying their tokens. FIP-21 creates a mechanism whereby holders of FIO Tokens who stake and vote/proxy their tokens are able to participate in the economic growth of the decentralized FIO Protocol itself.\nCreation of Staking Rewards Token Pool\nFor Staking to have impact, the FIO Blockchain must have a permanent mechanism to provide FIO Token rewards to those who stake and vote/proxy their FIO Tokens. FIP-21 provides an exceptional method for achieving this including a minimum guaranteed amount of FIO Tokens that would be paid out to Staked Tokens each day.\nFIP-21 starts by re-allocating the distribution of FIO Token fees received by the FIO Blockchain to cause 25% of those FIO Tokens to be distributed as Staking Rewards. In other words, FIO Tokens that are staked participate in the economic success of the decentralized FIO blockchain. As more and more users utilize FIO Address, FIO Domains, FIO Requests and other future features the FIO Token fees paid to the FIO blockchain will increase and so will the amount paid out in Staking Rewards.\nIn addition, FIP-21 creates a pool of 25 Million FIO Tokens to ensure that, at a minimum, for the first 1,000 days after FIO Staking is launched on the FIO blockchain that no less than 25,000 FIO Tokens would be available for Staking Rewards each day.\nHow Staking Rewards are Earned\nUsers desiring to participate in receiving Staking Rewards will simply vote or proxy their tokens and then stake them which causes the tokens to be locked until they are unstaked. Tokens which were locked at FIO Mainnet and are still locked are not eligible to participate. When a FIO Token is staked, it is allocated Staking Rewards Points on the FIO blockchain. Initially, each FIO token staked receives one Staking Rewards Point. But as the Token Rewards Pool grows, the Staking Rewards Points received for staking a FIO Token goes down. Thus, earlier stakings have more upside than later stakers. When a user Unstakes, they receive a number of FIO Tokens equal to the Staking Rewards Points they have divided by the then current \"Rate of Exchange\" between Staking Rewards Points and FIO Tokens. So, since that ratio is always declining, the unstaker always obtains more FIO Tokens than they staked and the faster the Toke Rewards Pool grows, the faster the Rate of Exchange declines meaning more earnings for those who staked earlier!\nThe Staking Rewards have several important attributes regarding how they are paid out:\nNo Chance to Lose Staked Tokens\nThe Staking method included in FIP-21 ensures that stakers of FIO Tokens will always earn a positive return — meaning they receive more FIO Tokens back when they unstake than the number they staked.\nEarlier Participants Receive Greater Rewards\nIn addition, it is structured such that FIO Tokens that are staked earlier receive a greater share of future rewards per FIO Token staked then tokens staked later.

The new code will be available on Theta GitHub on July 25, 2021, with the hard fork to 3.1.0 occurring at block height 11354820 (approximately 12pm July 30, 2021 PT). There will be no token swap or wallet changes associated with this hard fork, so no need to move your Theta or TFuel tokens or take any action on your end.\nMajor changes in Theta 3.1.0 update include:\nMore efficient block proposal protocol\nCurrently a validator block proposer waits 6 seconds before broadcasting the proposed block to guarantee liveness (i.e. chain progression). During the 6 seconds all the validators mostly sit idle. We designed a new block proposal protocol which eliminates the wait time without affecting liveness guarantees. Potentially the majority of the block time can be allocated for transaction execution, which greatly increases the efficiency and transactional throughput of the blockchain. This is a key enabling factor in high concurrent user video relaying or decentralized exchange, just to name a few use cases. Combined with off-chain micropayment aggregation, this transaction throughput can support 1,000,000+ concurrent users relaying video on Theta Network.\n2. Highly optimized blockchain database\nWith the current implementation, transaction processing can get slower as the database size grows, which will reduce the transaction throughput. We implemented the concept of \"rolling database\", which is specifically designed for blockchain state storage. Rolling enables much faster data read/write even when the database size grows very big. The update also introduces more efficient pruning, so disk size consumption will grow slower compared to now given the same amount of transactions per day.\n3. Faster snapshot import\nWith the 3.1.0 update, upon the first launch of a node, the snapshot validation and import time is reduced from roughly 45 mins to 15 mins. For end-users this will reduce the time to start up a new Guardian Node, and if your node falls out of sync it can sync back up to the blockchain much quicker.\n4. Support for Ethereum RPC API\nOver the past few months, BSC (Binance Smart Chain) and Polygon both saw massive user activity growth. This is largely due to their Ethereum compatible RPC APIs which tremendously reduces the effort for developers to port Ethereum DApps over. It also lowers the learning curves for users migrating from Ethereum, since the user experiences are virtually identical on different chains.\nRelease v3.1.0 along with the RPC adaptor project will provide support for the Ethereum RPC API, similar to BSC and Polygon, Ethereum dapps that are ported over to Theta can also use the same API calls to interact with Theta blockchain. This upgrade also paves the way for cross-chain bridge development since the Theta and Ethereum blockchains can share the same set of APIs.\nWe are excited to see Theta community use their development skills to build Theta-compatible versions of dapps, either independently or as part of the next iteration of Theta Hackathon coming soon. Additionally, the Theta team will continue to work on several demo projects to port popular Ethereum DApps (ex. Uniswap V2, including both the underlying smart contracts and the user-facing frontend) to Theta blockchain.", "document_type": "product_service_roadmap", "categories": ["Subject", "Applicable Date(s)", "Details"], "answer_list": ["Theta protocol to launch version 3.1.0", "2021-07-25T00:00:00", "On July 23rd, 2021, Theta Labs announced that the latest Theta protocol release version 3.1.0 will soon be released as a significant milestone for usability improvement for the Theta blockchain.

It utilizes an automated market making system instead of a traditional order-book. Rather than matching individual buy and sell orders, users can pool together two assets that are then traded against the smart contract. The price is ultimately determined based on the ratio between the two assets.\nSushiSwap is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) liquidity provision platform that is a fork of Uniswap.\nInitially, to encourage liquidity provision, liquidity providers can earn SUSHI tokens by staking Uniswap Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens in an initial set of available pools.\nOnce token swaps are enabled, 0.25% of all trading fees in any pool are proportionately distributed to active liquidity providers, while 0.05% get converted back to SUSHI (through SushiSwap) and distributed to SUSHI token holders.\nStaking SUSHI-ETH LP tokens on the SushiSwap platform grants stakers SUSHIPOWAH, which are voting rights that allow SUSHI token holders to vote on governance proposals that may shape the SushiSwap platform.\nStart Trading Now!\nDownload the Binance.US app here\nSUSHI/USD\n*Legal disclaimer:\nThis material has been prepared for general informational purposes only and should NOT be: (1) considered an individualized recommendation or advice; and (2) relied upon for any investment activities.

With this new mechanism, the VeChainThor blockchain is able to maximise its high throughput capability while also ensuring data finality. What this means in practice is that very high-volume use cases can exist on-chain with the highest level of data security unfound in any other blockchain platforms.\nWith this major update to our technical model, VeChainThor becomes the ideal open-source platform for enterprises, governments, or anyone looking to build their applications on a secure, low cost, immutable, and full featured public blockchain.\nToday, the VeChain Foundation is proud to be launching our brand new public testnet with VIP-193 fully implemented. This monumental milestone paves the way towards the full enactment of PoA 2.0 on mainnet.\nDescribed in the paper SURFACE: A Practical Blockchain Consensus Algorithm for Real-World Networks, the PoA 2.0 consensus algorithm contains three major components:\nThe VRF-based source of randomness,\nA committee-based block producing process and,\nA passive block finality confirmation process.\nThe algorithm is proposed via two VIPs (VeChain Improvement Proposals): VIP-193 and VIP-200. VIP-193 focuses on the first two components while VIP-200 describes the last component.\nAs per our roadmap illustrated below, the realisation of VIP-193 on public testnet has bolstered our confidence for the official implementation of this major upgrade to our technical suite.\nPoA 2.0: The Foundation of Economic Digitisation\nPoA 2.0 clears the way for large scale adoption of public blockchain, tackling the critical weaknesses of contemporary mechanisms found in other blockchains. Its key features include:\nA VRF-based source of randomness: A function that balances the unpredictability and the unbiasedness of the block-proposing schedule, ensuring the highest level of data security. For example — adversaries in this model are unable to either manipulate the leader selection process to control several consecutive block proposers nor predict and corrupt several consecutive block proposers way ahead in time.\nCommittee-endorsed block production: A process that significantly reduces the probability of forking, which decreases the confirmation delay and increases the throughput (TPS).\nThe finality mechanism: This feature provides block finality, i.e., performance even in asynchronous conditions and with uncompromised consistency. As a result, a block in PoA 2.0 will first be confirmed in a probabilistic fashion with very low latency before being finalized within a longer period of time. This means that a finalized block (as well as all the transactions packed in the block) could be theoretically proven immutable in any situation.\nA Certain Future\nPoA 2.0 was developed to meet the increasing demand for better performance and greater security from the enterprise and business-tier clients developing solutions with our toolsets. With the involvement of blockchain experts from top tier VeResearch partners contributing, PoA 2.0 is a significant milestone in the entire blockchain industry.\nWith VIP-193 now made public, VeChainThor continues on its mission to provide secure, scalable, reliable and cost-effective infrastructure-level protocols in anticipation of the wave of global digitisation that is just around the corner.\nIf you would like to test out the new functions of the new testnet, including deploying or building dApps, please make use of our faucet app, built by the VeChain core dev team.

The upgrade is focused on 'iExec Core', the backbone of iExec's distributed and confidential computing technology. iExec V6 arrives ahead of the iExec Oracle Factory product release later this year.\nIn parallel with the product release schedule outlined in the new 'Adoption Roadmap', iExec is continuously seeking to improve its fundamental technical infrastructure. iExec's version releases can include anything from middleware upgrades to UX improvements. iExec's previous major technical version, iExec V5: 'Interoperability Tools for DeFi' involved updates to the smart contracts of the iExec network. This latest release, iExec V6, introduces a variety of improvements to 'iExec Core' — the components of the iExec tech stack that handle distributed computing and confidential computing.\nWhat's inside?\nGet started:\niExec V6 Documentation:\n📚https://docs.iex.ec/\niExec V6 SDK:\n🛠 https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk\nEnclaves in Production Mode: A huge milestone for the iExec Confidential Computing solution!\niExec allows for a variety of confidential computing use cases. Any user of the platform can remotely trigger an application that can execute on sensitive or confidential data without ever revealing it to the host machine. This feature is particularly important in a decentralized computing network like iExec, as contributing machines (iExec Workers) carrying out computation may be 'untrusted'. In other words, the user requesting computation on their confidential data, does not necessarily know who will be executing on it.\nConfidential Computing on iExec is made possible by handling data processing in a 'Trusted Execution Environment' called a hardware enclave. iExec uses Intel® SGX hardware enclaves. The enclave is a CPU environment that ensures data remains confidential during the processing, meaning that even the owner of the hardware cannot access or tamper with the data. It's like a digital safe.\nSince Intel® SGX technology uses low-level programming language, iExec works with SCONE, an Intel® SGX wrapper, offering the ability to execute high-level docker containers inside Intel® SGX enclaves, available in all popular coding languages.\nBefore, much of the hardware enclaves used in the blockchain industry have relied on enclaves running in a default 'debug mode'. With the iExec V6 milestone, Intel® SGX enclaves will now be running in full production-mode. Running confidential applications in production mode is crucial to ensure no one can access 'secrets' (code or data that should not be inspected, accessed or manipulated by anyone). In production mode, any access to an enclave, including debug access, is prevented.\nPublic Worker Pools with TEE: iExec V6 makes this possible!\nEnclaves in production mode is a particularly exciting milestone as it allows for TEE Public Worker Pools! iExec has always had the goal of rewarding individual workers for executing confidential computing tasks. This means that machines are enabled with 'Trusted Execution Environments' (TEE), specifically Intel® SGX. As worker pools with hardware enclave technology provide more valuable business use cases, the iExec team is eager to get these TEE public worker pools available for the community in the mid-term.\nStandard Encryption: Encrypting Confidential Datasets, now easier and more efficient!\nIn order to guarantee the confidentiality of data, it is extremely important that any developer or data provider can encrypt their data in a way that is simple, efficient and standardized, without requiring any third party. Regarding the process of encrypting datasets on iExec, V6 brings vast improvements to both security and ease of use.\nAfter releasing the iExec Confidential Computing 'Secret Email' demo UI last year, the iExec team identified areas for improvement in the terms of how developers use iExec for confidential processing of private data. Before, the iExec Confidential Computing solution used the SCONE framework for encryption. Up until now, this presented some problems:\nThe previous encryption algorithm required the building of Docker images. This meant you could not encrypt on Windows OS, within a browser, or on mobile devices for example.\nThe previous encryption algorithm was limited by vendor lock-in for TEE services, meaning that the encryption could only be handled by other machines running on SCONE. This presented significant challenges for iExec, especially with their goal to have fully distributed TEE public worker pools.\nThe solution: AES-256-CBC standard encryption\nAES = 'Advanced Encryption Standard' is the symmetric encryption algorithm recommended by the NSA.\n256 = 246 bits, is the best available private key size.\nCBC = 'Cypher Block Chaining', is the method used for the relationship between different blocks of encrypted data, making attacks extremely difficult.\nIn short, AES-256-CBC encryption is: fast, secure, and used worldwide. In a standardized manner, it is now possible to encrypt data locally on any type of device. This makes life easier for developers that use the iExec solution. It also opens infinite possibilities for highly distributed confidential computing on iExec!\nImprovements to the iExec Middleware\nWhen a computational task is purchased on iExec and is are executed by iExec Workers, there are multiple middleware components that play important roles:\nThe scheduler, also known as an iExec Worker Pool Manager, leads iExec workers through the different stages of task execution.\nThe SMS and the post-compute application are necessary to ensure the smooth running of the tasks that use TEE technology.\nThe Result-Proxy is responsible for managing the result of the execution.\nAlongside the blockchain, all these services must work together to ensure the smooth running of computational tasks. In such a highly distributed system, fault tolerance for each of these components is essential.\nThe iExec Core team identified specific areas for improvement for the iExec middleware. See the full list of improvements here.\niExec V6 Strengthens the iExec Confidential Computing Offer\niExec has been building one of the first complete solutions for blockchain and confidential computing, since working with Intel in 2018. This led iExec to start working with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. iExec was then the main writer of the 'Trusted Compute Framework' tech specification. iExec later helped launch the Hyperledger Avalon. Since then, iExec has joined the Confidential Computing Consortium and is part of the Google Confidential Computing program. Three years later, iExec is continuing to strengthen its offer. The technical upgrades included in iExec V6 help to reinforce the iExec Trusted and Confidential computing solutions.\nGet started:\niExec V6 Documentation:\n📚https://docs.iex.ec/\niExec V6 SDK:\n🛠 https://github.com/iExecBlockchainComputing/iexec-sdk\nWhat's next? The iExec Oracle Factory\nThe iExec team is currently getting ready for the release of a new product: The iExec Oracle Factory. This new user interface will allow anyone to create their own oracles from scratch, directly from their browser! In 5 minutes, even without any blockchain knowledge, anyone will be able to deploy a 'trusted decentralized oracle'.\nWhen it comes to off-chain computing and oracles, the most promising technological innovations are hardware enclaves. With the ability to create trusted oracles in minutes, the iExec Oracle Factory aims to make this technology accessible to all.\nCreators on the Oracle Factory will get a unique link to share their oracle creation that can be listed in a dedicated gallery, ready for developers to deploy! iExec has various ideas for community events and competitions surrounding the Oracle Factory.

Total on-chain trading volume has now risen above $700B for the first time, indicating that stablecoins are on the rise and gaining rapid momentum.\nExcited by the possibilities opened by this explosive rise, we want to help pioneer the adoption of EURt, the first EUR-pegged stablecoin. As the crypto exchange of choice for everyone who values stability and reliability above all else, we'll start by listing EURt/EUR and EURt/USD.\nWhy stablecoins, you ask? Well, they're an attractive option for anyone who wants to transfer funds between entities and use the crypto market for fluctuation-free trading. Say goodbye to losses or gains from forex volatility on your transfers and trades, stablecoins are bringing you the stability you need.\nAccepted the world over, the US dollar is the global reserve currency and most stablecoins are pegged to it on a 1:1 basis. However, many of our users do have the euro as their domestic currency. We know how important it is to be able to trade in your own domestic currency, so this news should come as a delight to all our EU-based customers.\nBy using EURt, you'll have a good chance of removing FX volatility since no USDt intermediary is required. You can also avoid any potential loss of purchasing power if the euro loses strength. And if you're in the euro area, of course everything becomes easier because you're operating in your domestic currency.\nEURt has the potential to attract mass appeal, helping to further mainstream adoption of digital tokens. That's why we're also upbeat about all the future possibilities and products that could emerge from this launch. There's a huge gap in the market for products which accept a euro-pegged stablecoin, making widespread acceptance even closer to reality. Stay tuned!\nPlease note that EURt will not be available to our US and Singapore customers.\nListing schedule:\n1. Transfer-only mode [July 19]:: Deposits and withdrawals open but trading is not enabled yet.\n2. Post-only mode [July 22 at 8:00 AM UTC]: You will be able to place and cancel limit orders, but they will not be matched. Therefore, no orders will actually be completed during this stage.\n3. Limit-only mode [July 22 at 12:00 AM UTC]: Order matching will start and trades will be executed normally. However, only limit orders will be available.\n4. Full trading: Once the order books gather sufficient liquidity, we will enable all order types and card purchases for the new trading pairs as well.\nHere's a full list of new trading pairs to be added at Bitstamp:\nEURt/USD\nEURt/EUR\nOh, and to help celebrate the introduction of EURt, we're offering a hefty 90% discount on trading fees until the end of the year.

Our goal was to reinvent the wheel, without sacrificing user familiarity with Sushi's newly revamped and consolidated interface.\nBeing a community-centric platform, we are given priceless feedback from our users on a daily basis. With that information, we strive to constantly improve the Sushi user's DeFi experience, but also knew that there were certain pain points for DeFi users in general that made simple transactions either confusing or expensive, or both, resulting in costly, irreversible mistakes.\nWith this in mind, we knew that we couldn't be comfortable with minimal updates to appease simple design or site flow inconveniences, especially due to the recent rehaul, asking the Sushi community to relearn a new Sushi site again would be too big of an ask. Big changes were needed, fundamental changes, but, more importantly, we needed you, our community members, to barely notice them.\nTrident's beginnings originate with inspirations from the Sushi team's original discussions with Yearn Finance's Andre Cronje about Deriswap and from the Mirin, Sushi AMM V2 proposal written by Sushi Core Developer, LevX.\nThe focus of Deriswap was capital efficiency by removing liquidity silos between various financial tools such as:\ni. Trading protocols (or swap-focused platforms, like Sushi)\nii. Lending protocols (or margin trading-focused platforms, like Aave)\niii. Option protocols (like Deribit)\nDeriswap: Capital efficient swaps, futures, options, and loans\nI have become increasingly obsessed with capital efficiency. Current liquidity is segmented. You get to choose one of;\nandrecronje.medium.com\nYou will see throughout this Trident explanation, the focus we have placed on our next generation AMM's capital efficiency and see how we have created a solution to seamlessly integrate and intertwine Sushi's many products to give you a DeFi experience as never imagined.\nMirin will now be retired as we move forward with Trident development.\nPart of this newly envisioned DeFi horizon was paved by the Mirin proposal. Community members rejoice! The highly anticipated Franchised Pools are in the works, along with LevX's proposed expansion of liquidity provider (LP) curve options.\nSushi Protocol v3 Proposal: MIRIN\nIf you thought our 2021 resolution was simply being at the top of the DEX charts, think bigger. Welcome to the MIRIN…\nmedium.com\nTrident is a new AMM from Sushi currently in development and not a fork.\nWho needs a fork when you have a trident?\nThe Trident release celebratory limited edition NFT titled: Bad Trip\nTrident — First Prong\nBentoBox's First Native AMM Elevates Trident To New Heights\nThe term \"Next Generation AMM\" is very justified to describe Trident, thanks to the power of Sushi's token vault, BentoBox. The BentoBox can also be considered as an architectural platform that allows developers to build complex, capital-efficient applications on top of it, such as Trident, for example.\nIf you have given BentoBox a try, which we highly recommend doing so here with the Kashi platform, you will know that BentoBox allows for single token approval for usage across all its apps, saving you time and gas money! Not only that, BentoBox applies something called \"strategies\" to the assets deposited within it, earning its users passive yields at no fee cost.\nTo better illustrate, take the BentoBox Sushi Strategy for example. If you were to take your $SUSHI tokens from your wallet and deposit them into your BentoBox token vault, without doing anything else and without paying any gas fees other than the send fee from your wallet, you will start earning Sushi.com platform fees, accrued from staking $SUSHI in the SushiBar. Even if your assets are sitting in your BentoBox balance idly, you will automatically be earning yields from strategies that are applied to the vault.\nThe Sushi Strategy is one of many strategies that can be applied at once to BentoBox. The potential given to users by this powerful vault and the limitless possibilities of strategy design was the reason for Trident to be built upon it and why we coin this new AMM as the most capital efficient in DeFi in existence.\nTrident — Second Prong\nAn Expansion of Pool Type Options\nAs of now, many decentralized exchanges rely on the constant product pool formula as their infrastructure. Trident is intended to be, at minimum, a superset of all AMM pool designs, by adding multiple pool types to provide relief for many of the pain points experienced due to the siloed liquidity problem and to protect users from price impacts and other risks that are faced by cryptocurrency holders.\nDue to the nature of DeFi, technology, ideas and possibilities go from ideation to implementation at lightning-fast speeds and to ensure that the Sushi protocol is prepared for unforeseen updates to the DeFi horizon, Trident allows for simple integration of added pool types. This integration is made possible by standardizing the pool interface which allows adding new pool designs as long as they conform to the interface; Told you that without this explanation you would barely notice it!\nNew Pools\nInitially, Trident has been developed with four pool types, the first should look a little familiar to say the least.\nConstant Product Pool\nTo refresh your memory, constant product pools are made up of two assets at an equal monetary value of each. To better explain, if you wanted to add $200 of liquidity to the current Sushi AMM's SUSHI-WETH pair, you would have to add $100 of SUSHI tokens and $100 of WETH tokens to complete your transaction. If you only have $80 worth of SUSHI tokens, than you can only match it with $80 worth of WETH to make a $160 addition of liquidity to the AMM. Luckily, thanks to the zap in/zap out feature, these limitations are no more! You can add any amount of assets and we'll swap the for you behind the scenes to make everything evened out.\nIn this pool type, swaps function automatically, hence the term Automated Market Maker (AMM), thanks to the formula: x*y=k, also known as the, constant product formula.\nHybrid Pool\nHybrid pools were included to allow users to swap like-kind assets at reduced price impacts. In hybrid pools, users can include up to 32 assets in just one pool! Based on a stableswap curve, this allows for similar assets to be traded amongst one another in a single pool, with less interference from other market factors or obviously dissimilar tokens.\nLiquidity providers using this pool type will receive NFTs in lieu of ERC20 LP tokens.\nConcentrated Liquidity Pool\nOne of the more exciting pool types to splash onto Trident is the concentrated liquidity pool, which asks users to specify the token asset's price range to add liquidity to.\nTraditionally, when you are a liquidity provider on SushiSwap, you receive platform transaction fees from swaps within your LP pool at a rate of your share of the entire pool itself, regardless of a token's price. As DeFi protocols, such as Sushi, increase in popularity, your share of the pool can get smaller and smaller, until it's almost miniscule. This pool style aims to tackle that lack of LP incentivization due to unattractive pool shares.\nAs shown in the picture to the left, liquidity providers will be able to select the token price range in which they wish to receive platform fees. This is in the hopes that the amount of the pool that you need to share with fellow providers will spread more evenly between several ranges, offering you a bigger piece of the pie in your selected range, which means in higher fee accumulation.\nFor concentrated liquidity pools the ultimate benefit is that it will allow liquidity providers to more narrowly scope their liquidity provisioning to maximize share of revenue they receive from platform swap fees across Sushi.com.\nOne thing that you might have noticed about these Trident teasers is the fact that they are all taken from mobile wire frames. As mentioned in the core team interview done by Ramin, found here, Sushi has moved to a \"mobile-first\" UI mindset to better keep up with trends and attract a new set of users.\nWeighted Pool\nWeighted pools will be similar to constant product pools with the exception that the pools allow different weight types, breaking the limitation of requiring a 1:1 value match between both assets in a pair, as is the case with constant product pools. Even better, weighted pools can support up to 8 tokens at the same time.\nAgain, weighted pools allow liquidity providers to specify the percentage of each asset in the pair. Being no longer restricted to 50% — 50%, users will have the ability to give 20% of the pool in one asset and 80% of the other, just as long as together they total 100%.\nTo use the illustration above, let's say you had $80 worth of SUSHI tokens and $100 worth of WETH. Together you can add $180 worth of liquidity, with your $80 of SUSHI tokens making up 44.44% of the pair and your $100 in WETH comprising of the remaining 55.56%.\nA constant product pool has 50/50 weights of Token X to Token Y. Weighted pools will allow an arbitrary weight of Token X to Token Y. The advantage of this pool type is that it shifts the price impacts by the token weights.\nA variety of pool types gives users the power to choose pools that best suit their risk profile and a more refined method of crypto money management.\nTrident — Third Prong\nTines: Routing Engine\nTines is our new routing engine designed for the front end to make the Sushi interface more intuitive. Tines is an efficient multihop, multiroute swap router. Multihop deals with searching multiple pools to perform a and multiroute deals with searching multiple paths a token takes to exchange into another. Tines will query our many pool types, and consider factors such as gas costs, price impacts, and graph topology to generate the best price solution.\nNow that Sushi will have multiple pools with Trident, the multihop can search for through more possibilities for low price opportunities, maximizing the ability of the SushiSwap swap function.\nYou might remember that when you perform a swap on Sushi.com, the route of your swap will display as part of the details of the transaction (SUSHI → WETH → AXS, eg). There are no Sushi — Axie Infinity pools on Sushi, but there are AXS — WETH pairs and SUSHI — WETH pairs, so switching the from token to the common denominator token pair of the to token when swapping is what we call a route. When performing a swap in the past, we were limited to these route styles, but with the Tines multiroute ability, we can perform trades horizontally to minimize price impacts (slippage).\nDifferent asset types perform better in different pool types. For instance, like-kind assets such as wBTC and renBTC tend to perform better in hybrid pools. Tines will allow routing more effectively to make multiple pools act as a unified pool resulting in drastically reduced price impacts.\nLicense (GPL3)\nAt Sushi, we firmly believe in standardization across DeFi will propel protocols across the board to mass adoption and, in line with that ethos, until and beyond that standard is set, we will continue to have an open source ecosystem. Our new set of Next Generation AMM: Trident contracts are GPL3, and we view it as a matter of principle to release all software developed by the Sushi team to be under GPL3, or other permissive OSS licenses.\nHere, here!\nPost Launch Roadmap\nTrident will be launching within the next couple of weeks, but we have more exciting news for the new AMM in the pipeline. Coming to its subsequent version are the follow upgrades:\nFranchised pools\nOne of Sushi's more ambitious features are its plan for franchised pools. As you may recall, this AMM function hopes to drive liquidity by incentivizing LPs who keep their assets in centralized exchanges. Following the launch of Trident, the organization will begin working on these awaited franchise pools, which promise to unite the CEX and DEX for a mutually beneficial cause. We aim to make this match while meeting the needs of the compliance of centralized exchanges. These pools will, thus, be differentiated from the main Trident AMM and will allow institutions to whitelist liquidity providers and swappers.\nStorage Proof TWAP\nThe Trident implementation will allow for the presentation of a storage proof to give two simultaneous snapshots of the cumulative price. To do this, the user using the TWAP price will present a merkle proof where the block root is less than 256 blocks behind the canonical head. On chain, the contracts will confirm the validity of the storage proof and value to allow an instant TWAP snapshot. We have repurposed another implementation for Kashi and is currently deployed on Polygon, as well as working on a reduced gas consumption version for a deployment on Ethereum. The benefit of TWAP is that it's a fully decentralized, trustless price oracle for all assets.\nETHCC Event\nAt the SushiSwap presentation held in Paris, France at 2PM CEST, Sushi CTO, Joseph Delong, announced to attendees the upcoming Sushi Trident AMM. As a special token of remembrance for those who heard it first, each in attendance was given a special Sushi card that will grant them access to the NFT version of the \"Bad Trip\" NFT posted towards the beginning of this article.\nSushi — The Future of France!\nFor those in our community who were unable to be present for this special event, we have minted 20 tokenized versions of this NFT that make up a 1/20 fraction of its entirety. These limited edition fractionalized pieces will be available for bidding on MISO starting from July 20th, 2021 at 4PM UTC, by visiting miso.sushi.com.\nSushi is building a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem with AMM, leverage & margin trading platform, token launchpad and NFT artist platform.

With several Core Units approved by governance to efficiently organize all areas of work within the DAO and the global community now responsible for every aspect of the Maker Protocol, the DAO is now fully self-sufficient and the Maker Foundation has fulfilled its bootstrapping responsibilities. The Foundation will formally dissolve within the next few months. Despite experiencing all that led to this moment, it's hard to believe it's actually arrived. Six years ago, when I introduced the first iteration of Dai—what I called the eDollar—on Reddit, I hoped that it would become a popular currency that average people could use on Ethereum to interact with dapps—without having to worry about insane volatility. Today, there are over 5 billion Dai in circulation and over $8 billion in assets locked in the smart contracts of the Maker Protocol.\nMaker has come a long way in a relatively short period of time. It's gone from a DAO, created by myself and a few passionate developers, to a Foundation tasked with bootstrapping an amazing project, and back to a DAO. While the Foundation played a specific and important role in the further development of the Maker Protocol and the growth of a global team, it was designed to exist only temporarily. It was created as a means to an extraordinary end—a self-governed, self-operating DAO. From the earliest days of Maker, everyone involved worked tirelessly to devise a framework for scientific governance and create an infrastructure for a new generation of open financial services that can be used by anyone, anywhere, anytime. We all hoped for success, but knew it would never be guaranteed. We realized that only a very independent, passionate, and committed Maker community could make success a reality in the end. And it has.\nWith each technological and philosophical milestone mapped over the years by the initial DAO members and later by Foundation teams, the global Maker community embraced its governance responsibilities. People all over the world came together to discuss at length the ramifications and viability of each concept, module, UX, and more proposed, and with every Executive Vote cast, took another clear-eyed step toward complete decentralization. The community repeatedly acted in ways that supported the Foundation's efforts to put slow and methodical development over rushing to get the code out. And that practice helped earn MakerDAO a stellar reputation for progressing carefully, only after a lot of testing and thorough auditing. What's more, the community proved proactive over the years by independently designing creative solutions to a range of problems and discovering new opportunities to grow.\nTogether, we've accomplished something extraordinary, and on this very exciting day, I want to take the opportunity to thank all of the people who've played a part in this amazing journey. Without the OGs who attended the very first Sunday afternoon TeamSpeak calls, the hard-working Foundation team members, and everyone else in Maker's wonderfully diverse community, there would be no MakerDAO. MAKERDAO MILESTONES: 2015-2021\nMarch 26, 2015: MakerDAO and its first stablecoin are introduced\nThe original concept for Dai (then called the \"eDollar) was described in a reddit post.

This was an early introduction of the organization and the Protocol to the wider Ethereum community in the blockchain's early days.\nMay 2017: ProtoSai goes live\nMakerDAO developers launch and begin to use the first version of Dai, called ProtoSai. This marks the first limited release of the Dai Stablecoin System and was a precursor to the public launch of Single-Collateral Dai (SAI) several months later.\nDecember 10, 2017: The Sai white paper is published\nThe original white paper describing the Dai Stablecoin System articulates the final design for SAI and provides a roadmap for the future—including the ultimate goal of Multi-Collateral Dai.\nDecember 19, 2017: Sai launches\nSingle-Collateral Dai goes live; it would eventually kickstart the now popular DeFi movement.\nJune 21, 2018: The Foundation Proposal is published The proposal, later updated, lays out the core principles for sustainable decentralized governance.\nNovember 18, 2019: Multi-Collateral Dai goes live\nThe launch of Multi-Collateral Dai enables anyone to generate Dai against digital assets approved by Maker governance.\nMarch 25, 2020: The MKR token contract is transferred to Maker governance.\nWith MKR holders now in full control of the MKR contract, decentralized governance is the only avenue for changing MKR token authorizations.\nMay 2, 2020. The MIPs framework is approved\nMaker Improvement Proposals (MIPs) framework, which includes MIP0 and two MIP sets, is ratified.\nMarch 25, 2021: The Core Units framework is ratified\nThe Core Units framework paves the way for decentralized management of all Maker Protocol teams and activities.\nMay 3, 2021: The Maker Foundation returns Dev Fund holdings to the DAO\nThe return of 84,000 MKR to the DAO is another crucial step in the march toward further decentralization.

Continuation of the program will require an additional governance vote. Upon renewal of the program, each of the three initiatives can be broken out into separate proposals.\nThe program will aim to bootstrap liquidity across three different initiatives:\nStablecoin pairs\nMid-tail pairs (e.g DeFi governance tokens)\nDeposit receipt tokens (i.e. cTokens, aTokens)\nSimilarly to the Uniswap Grants Program (UGP), pair selection is a subjective process that cannot be easily automated: any action requires close monitoring and frequent reporting to the Uniswap community. To this end, we propose a discretionary committee of 8 members — 5 core members from LlamaDAO to actively lead & manage the committee, as well 3 members for oversight. Find LlamaDAO's full proposal & management plan detailed here 44.\nThe committee structure allows for incentives to be allocated efficiently across many pairs without requiring a full governance vote on each pair selection. However, Uniswap governance retains ultimate oversight by granting a budget on a bi-quarterly basis.\nWe hope that the Uniswap community will suggest additional application questions throughout the proposal process.\nPurpose & Background:\nWhile Uniswap v3 has quickly emerged as the market leading DEX, we believe that it has yet to reach its full potential. In particular, large amounts of liquidity remain locked in Uniswap v2, and a majority of v2 LPs have yet to migrate over the v3.\nLiquidity incentive programs have seen varying degrees of success. In Uniswap's case, the initial liquidity incentive program between September—November 2020 was met with considerable interest:\nProtocol liquidity quickly increased from ~$750M in the week preceding the program to ~$3B at peak.\nThe number of individual addresses holding more than 0 LP tokens increased by ~75% from ~33,500 to ~59,000.\nThe unique UNI token holder base grew by 14% over the course of 2 months.\nA contributing factor here is that Uniswap v2 has an organic user-base, which drives organic swap yields to LPs.\nWe expect and hope that a liquidity incentives program on Uniswap v3 would succeed in increasing wider LP participation, liquidity across sought-after pairs, UNI distribution, and swap volume. Importantly, due to v3's Concentrated Liquidity feature, Uniswap governance can afford to pay significantly lower reward rates than previous liquidity mining programs to achieve similar market depth.\nQuarterly Budget:\nMax quarterly budget of up to 820,039 UNI across all initiatives to start\nIn addition to the quarterly budget, LlamaDAO (core committee members) is to be collectively compensated at a rate of $150 per hour up to 30 hours a week. Each month, oversight members will be responsible for calculating exchange rate from UNI to USD and appropriate payouts (estimated at ~2917 UNI per quarter), with payments being made in UNI.\nOversight members will be compensated at a rate of 300 UNI per quarter.\nPair Selection Committee:\n5 core committee members, composed of LlamaDAO team members for the first term, as well as 3 oversight committee members.\nEach committee has a term of 2 quarters (6 months) after which the program and members need to be renewed by UNI governance.\nCommittee functions as a 5 of 6 multi-sig, with 3 members of LlamaDAO and 3 members from the oversight committee.\nCommittee to share a weekly report detailing the decision making process (using a standard template) and periodic updates detailing the successes and failures of the program.\nCommittee Members:\nCommittee member criteria include:\nCredibly neutral — need to avoid any sense of conflict of interest\nAbility to evaluate fundamental strengths of projects and their place in the ecosystem\nData driven — capable of assessing quantitative merits/growth signals\nCommittee members must recuse themselves from any ULP decision related to a project they hold an investment in or are otherwise related to.\nCore Committee Members (LlamaDAO):\nAG 14: project management and evaluation\nShreyas Hariharan 6: project management, coordinate with Uniswap governance and stakeholders\nMason 21: project management, create progress reports on ULP, coordinate with projects\nAustin Green 15: technical and security expertise\nKiba Gateaux 8: technical and governance expertise (DAO tooling, admin keys, multisig wallets)\nOversight Committee Members:\nEva Beylin, Graph Protocol\nJon Itzler, Variant Fund\nArr00, Core Compound community contributor\nImplementation:\nUNI is distributed to LPs that provide in-range liquidity, with those that concentrate their liquidity closer to the market price (i.e. higher virtual liquidity) receiving larger allocations.\nGitHub\nRelease Mainnet Deployment - v1.0.0 · Uniswap/uniswap-v3-staker 22\nThe staker is deployed and verified on Etherscan for on all networks at the address: 0x1f98407aaB862CdDeF78Ed252D6f557aA5b0f00d Network Explorer Mainnet https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f9840...\nInitial Proposed Reward Distribution Across Initiatives:\nStablecoin pairs:\nWe suggest an initial stablecoin/stablecoin liquidity mining program over the course of the next three months conservatively targeting $250m in each of the following pools:\nUSDC/DAI [0.05% fee tier]\nUSDC/USDT [0.05% fee tier]\nDAI/USDT [0.05% fee tier]\nA reward rate of 2% APY feels like an appropriate target for stablecoin/stablecoin pools as v3 stablecoin/stablecoin pools are already generating organic yields in-line with money market protocols.\nBased on a 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, the committee would distribute 741.82 UNI per day to each of the three pools listed above for a total of 186,939 UNI across all three pools over the next quarter.\nMid-tail pairs\nWe suggest an initial mid-tail pair liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. We are conservatively targeting $100m in each of the following pools:\nLINK/ETH [0.30% fee tier]\nYFI/ETH [0.30% fee tier]\nMKR/ETH [0.30% fee tier]\nAAVE/ETH [0.30% fee tier]\nCOMP/ETH [0.30% fee tier]\nA reward rate of 10% APY feels appropriate for mid-tail pair pools. Compared to stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in mid-tail pairs must bear more price risk.\nBased on the 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, 1,483.64 UNI per day to each of the five pools listed above for a total of 623,130.61 UNI across all five pools over the next quarter.\nDeposit Receipt Tokens (DRT)\nWe suggest an initial DRT liquidity mining program over the course of the next quarter. Due to Uniswap's brand recognition and gas optimized contracts, deeply liquid DRT pools may serve as an effective alternative distribution channel for yield-generating platforms. We are conservatively targeting $10m in each of the following pools:\nDAI/cDAI [0.05% fee tier] [Compound]\nUSDC/aUSDC [0.05% fee tier] [Aave]\nETH/wstETH [0.05% fee tier] [Lido]\nUSDC/PcUSDC [0.05% fee tier] [PoolTogether]\nAs with stablecoin/stablecoin pools, LPs in DRT pairs take on minimal price risk. Additionally, they earn passive yield by maintaining inventories of yield-bearing assets. A reward rate of 2% feels appropriate.\nBased on the 30D moving average UNI price of $20.06, the committee would distribute 29.67 UNI per day to each of the four pools listed above for a total of 9,970.09 UNI across all four pools over the next quarter.\nConclusion:\nWe recommend the establishment of a Uniswap Liquidity Program (ULP), which will actively incentivize liquidity across three strategic categories:\nStablecoin/stablecoin pairs\nMid-tail pairs\nDepositary receipt pairs\nULP will exist as a 8-person committee with 5 core members, where core committee members are tasked with closely monitoring ongoing programs and frequently updating the Uniswap community via regular written reports. The 3 oversight members are responsible for monitoring the core committee and multisig signing.\nWe believe that the targeted nature of ULP's proposals coupled with Uniswap's organic user base will help achieve various objectives: wider LP participation, more liquidity across sought-after pairs, further UNI distribution, and increasing swap volume.\nNext Steps:\nWe want the establishment of ULP to be a community-driven process. We actively seek questions and feedback from the Uniswap community over the next 5 days and hope to incorporate relevant points.

Optimism's roadmap promises further powerful improvements including additional scaling, smart wallet EOAs (no \"approves\", pay gas in any token), and decentralization of the transaction sequencing operation.\nDuring this Alpha period, OΞ will support an initial throughput of 0.6 transactions per second. Because Uniswap v3 is currently one of the few protocols deployed to OΞ, this should translate to transaction capacity roughly in line with L1. Unlike L1, transactions on OΞ confirm instantly — no more pending or stuck swaps!\nAssuming Uniswap v3 sees equal usage to L1, OΞ should offer up to 10x transaction cost savings. Additional demand will drive gas costs higher — for more details, check out Optimism's blog post. Transaction speeds will ramp up over the coming weeks and months as the OΞ infrastructure is tested and optimized at scale, with the end goal of scaling to fully meet demand for low cost, high speed DEX trading.\nFor more information on how Optimistic Ethereum works and its security model, check out this blog post.\nLaunch Details\nUsers can start migrating assets over to the Optimism Ethereum network through the Optimism Gateway. A detailed user guide is available here. Optimism is already compatible with popular wallets (Metamask, WalletConnect), Etherscan, and The Graph. Analytics can be tracked at info.uniswap.org/#/optimism/.\nPlease treat this as an early alpha product. Optimistic Ethereum is a complex Layer 2 scaling solution still in need of rigorous battletesting. At launch, the Optimism team will have upgrade rights over the bridge contract, allowing them to address any bugs that should arise.\nThere are a few more Alpha launch features to be aware of:\nDowntime: There will be downtime (both planned and likely unplanned) during the early days of OΞ, during which LPs will not earn trading fees to compensate for price exposure. We will communicate scheduled downtime ahead of time through social media channels.\nWithdrawal Times: Deposits from Ethereum L1 to Optimistic Ethereum are instant. However, until fast withdrawal services are made available, withdrawals from OΞ to L1 will take 7 days.\nSelect Assets: Uniswap v3 can support any ERC20 token on OΞ, but will offer a limited number of assets at launch (ETH, USDT, WBTC, DAI, SNX). More tokens will be bridged to Optimistic Ethereum over the coming days and weeks.\nTWAP Oracles: The Optimism sequencer introduces an additional trust assumption for developers using v3 price feeds.\nComposability: OΞ supports full composability. However, at launch, the network does not permit arbitrary smart contract deployment. Reach out to the Optimism team on Discord if you would like to deploy your contracts on OΞ.\nScaling Ethereum will be an iterative process, but this is a major step forward.

The Internet will never be the same.\nCuration is an essential component of the data economy. Data is the world's most valuable asset – but only if it is useful, accurate, and reliable.\nCentralized intermediaries that control the process of collecting and organizing the world's data have grown immensely over the past decade, all at the expense of their users who supply that data in the first place.\nToday, The Graph transforms data curation on the web. With the launch of curation, Graph Explorer and Subgraph Studio, data curation is now an open, competitive market. After years of hard work putting each piece of this infrastructure in place, we're thrilled to announce this enormous milestone for Web3 and the Internet as a whole.\nWe believe that permissionless, open curation beats extractive algorithms and centralized decision making every time. We think that existing data intermediaries, who maintain full control over how information is served to their users - no matter how poorly they perform their centralized role - have run their course. Join us in this massive next step for the decentralized data economy.\nOpen, uncensored data powered by Curation, Graph Explorer and Subgraph Studio\nCuration is live on the decentralized network with the launch of the Graph Explorer dapp and Subgraph Studio. Now anyone can permissionlessly deploy subgraphs (open APIs) and curate on subgraphs to earn query fees! Curation on The Graph is one of the first curation markets to go live on Ethereum at this scale.\nThere are 8 dapps currently relying on subgraphs in production on the decentralized network. Subgraphs are queried by dapps to fetch blockchain data to power their front-end interfaces. Now that subgraphs can be published to the network, developers and end-users can be sure that their app is relying on decentralized infrastructure with reduced central points of failure and greater uptime. Developers can use the new Subgraph Studio to test and publish subgraphs directly to The Graph Network.\nCurators can now curate subgraphs by signalling on the best subgraphs in the Graph Explorer and earn a portion of query fees. Curation is critical to the Web3 ecosystem to ensure that the highest quality data on The Graph is surfaced to developers and Indexers. Read on to learn how to become a curator and signal on subgraphs as they migrate to the decentralized network. It is now possible to take part in the decentralized data economy and earn for your contributions.\nThe Graph Explorer and Subgraph Studio were developed by the team at Edge & Node working closely with The Graph community.\nstandard\nIntroducing Curation\nSimilar to leaving restaurant reviews on Yelp or upvoting posts on Reddit, curation is a decentralized form of platform governance to ensure quality and accuracy of information. However, Web2 curation relies on centralized intermediaries or in-groups while in Web3 we aim to create free markets so anyone can be a Curator. One kind of curation market you may be familiar with is known as a Token Curated Registry (TCR), which was first introduced in the Ethereum community in 2017. In The Graph, Curators play the role of signalling to Indexers which subgraphs are most important to decentralized applications.\nThe earlier you are able to curate the better. Curators stake GRT to signal on subgraphs they believe provide the greatest utility and have high quality and reliability. Once a Curator stakes GRT, signal is minted along a bonding curve such that the impact of additional signal can vary, so it's important that a Curator understands the utility and bonding curve dynamics of the subgraph they're signalling on, including the risk that they could lose staked GRT. Signal indicates to the network's Indexers which subgraphs they should prioritize for indexing and processing queries. Curators earn a portion of the subgraph's query fees and are thus incentivized to support the subgraphs that power the most used applications. Currently the Curator's cut is 10% but is subject to protocol governance. To mitigate spam and economic attacks, Curators also pay a small Curation Tax that burns a portion of staked GRT. Read more about Curation mechanisms here.\nWith a community of over 2,000 Curators that participated in the Curator Program, we're excited for Curation to be live. Being a Curator is a non-technical role, anyone can be a Curator by simply assessing which subgraphs would be most useful to dapps and end users - such as those providing data on DeFi trade volume, NFT marketplaces, DAO voting results and more! Evaluate a subgraph's query fees, the subgraph's details, accuracy of data and project information. Visit the Graph Explorer and use your expertise to curate on a subgraph you believe in long-term!\nYaniv Tal, CEO of Edge & Node said:\n\"The Graph is without a doubt one of the most complex protocols on any blockchain. These products hide the complexity of interacting with the network behind a beautiful design and give developers, curators, and the rest of the community the tools they need to organize all of the data for the crypto economy.\"\nThe Internet will never be the same\nToday, we launch powerful new components that help achieve The Graph's vision. With the launch of the Graph Explorer and Subgraph Studio we can now welcome Curators and Subgraph Developers to seamlessly participate in the network.\nIt has never been so easy to use or build an API. Whether you're building a DeFi protocol or an NFT marketplace, a subgraph can be seamlessly published for your development needs. Best of all, others can also take advantage of your subgraph for their dapps, and pay fees for their queries. If you truly believe in your subgraph, you should curate on it so you can earn a portion of query fees as a result of others using that subgraph. By being Curators on their subgraphs, developers can benefit from the network effects of their hard work!\nstandard\nThe Graph Explorer is the go-to source for information about subgraphs and the network.\nIf you're a Curator, Indexer or Subgraph Developer, peruse subgraphs to see which are the highest quality and should be prioritized in the network. Curators and Indexers can stake on their preferred subgraphs that they believe will be most useful and will see the greatest query volume. Developers can learn more about each subgraph's details for integrating with their applications. If you're a Delegator, you might be more interested in viewing Indexer information like the subgraphs they're indexing, total query fees earned and staking efficiency metrics.\nEach subgraph in the Explorer will have details like the subgraph description, developers, project links, query fee data and charts, deployment ID, API endpoint and other metadata. The focus of these details is to empower The Graph users to make informed decisions about how to organize relevant and useful data in production on the network.\nWhen signaling, curators can decide to signal on a specific version of the subgraph or to signal using auto-migrate. When signaling using auto-migrate, a curators' shares will always be upgraded to the latest version published by the developer. If you decide to signal on a specific version instead, shares will always stay on this specific version.\nSubgraph developers can also manage their profile within their revamped user settings, where they can set their ENS name, add in their repo, and set profile details.\nstandard\nPublish a Subgraph from the Subgraph Studio\nThe Subgraph Studio is the launchpad to the decentralized network. It is your place to test, create and publish subgraphs for you and the world to use. All subgraphs that are published from the Subgraph Studio can be viewed in the Graph Explorer, so you can explore other complete and high-quality subgraphs built by other developers too!\nSubgraph Studio represents a fundamental shift in delivering software. Now developers can publish subgraphs to mainnet by deploying to the Studio and paying for query fees seamlessly via gateways and billing. Developers will be able to top-up their accounts with GRT to pay for subgraph query fees.\nThe Studio is secure infrastructure for you to build your subgraphs, also enabling you to test subgraphs ahead of publishing to the network and manage billing to pay for query fees. Developers can manage their subgraph's API keys and will be able to customize settings like rate-limiting, domain names restrictions. Expect more features to come soon!\nMigrate Your Subgraph!\nSince starting The Graph, the vision has always been to develop a decentralized network as soon as it was technically feasible. It is now time for dapps to begin migrating subgraphs with many dapps already in production -- LivePeer, Audius, UMA, mStable, Reflexer, Opyn , PoolTogether, DODO . You can migrate your subgraph by heading to the Subgraph Studio, redeploying your subgraph and publishing on mainnet. Reach out to the community in The Graph's Discord or Forum to receive support during your dapp's migration.\nDevelopers can benefit greatly from using subgraphs on the decentralized network instead of hosted service! Benefits of the decentralized network include:\nNo downtime by relying on a network of Indexers to serve data\nReduced central point of failure in infrastructure and service providers\nInnovate faster by building on open source APIs\nPaying query fees only for data that you consume\nEnsure your dapp is built on fully decentralized infrastructure\nSave on engineering costs, less redundant back-end and indexing work\nApplications that rely on The Graph Network for querying on-chain data can significantly benefit from the reduced back-end work required to serve data to their front-end.\nMigration Rewards for All Subgraph Developers\nThe Graph wouldn't be where it is today without subgraph developers who have built the open source APIs that the majority of Ethereum dapps rely on today. That is why The Graph Foundation is rewarding all eligible past subgraph developers with GRT to support their migration from the hosted service to the decentralized network. The GRT can be used to curate on migrated subgraphs or to pay for a dapp's query fees!\nOver 2,000 subgraph developers who redeemed their Subgraph Developer POAP NFT received 685 GRT to their Ethereum addresses.\nIf you have not redeemed your Subgraph Developer NFT, check your email and redeem by July 15, 2021 at 12pm PST. A final distribution of the subgraph developer rewards will occur by July 22, 2021 to all developers that redeem their POAP by July 15th and have not failed KYC in past programs with The Graph.\nWe thank subgraph developers for their contributions and look forward to seeing your dapps and APIs on the network. The GRT earned can be used to support seamless migration from the hosted service to the network by publishing the subgraphs on the Subgraph Studio and paying for query fees.", "document_type": "milestone_achievement", "categories": ["Name", "Date", "Accomplished", "Details"], "answer_list": ["The Graph Launches the Decentralized Data Economy with Curation, Graph Explorer & Subgraph Studio", "2021-07-08T00:00:00", "YES", "On July 8th, 2021, The Graph Foundation announced that they had launched the Decentralized Data Economy with Curation, Graph Explorer, & Subgraph Studio.Curation is live on the decentralized network with the launch of the Graph Explorer dApp and Subgraph Studio.
